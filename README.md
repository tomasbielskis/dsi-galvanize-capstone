Metafilter.com (MeFi) post recommender 

What's MeFi?

MetaFilter is a community weblog where users post interesting content found on the web and engage in discussions about it. The community prides itself in exposing a diverse set of posts about what's best and most interesting on the internet. The site has over 70,000 registered users and has been around for almost 20 years. Despite having a very engaged and active user base, the site is fairly basic and old-school, containing only text content and links, and no advertising. 

Problem statement

Like many online communities and sites, MeFi harbors a wealth of content far exceeding what is possible for an individual user to explore. Popular posts tend to get a lot more exposure than the noticed but equaly deserving ones. This self-fulfilling quality of popularity is an evil that we ought to fight! 

Mission statement

With my project, I attempted to facilitate content discovery on MeFi and circumvent the trouble caused by post popularity by quantifying the tastes and preferences of individual users and aligning them with the explicit and implicit characteristics of posts and comments.
