Scientists struggle to properly catalog and describe the varieties of crabs they find in pet stores.Geosesarma have a small but avid fan club comprised of people from both the exotic pet and aquarium worlds.  Hobbyists were surprised to find out that scientists weren\\'t aware of or had not scientifically cataloged at least two species that were well known in the trade.  Since Geosesarmas started showing up in the trade about 10 years ago, it has been the norm to actively search out captive bred crabs, but because of the concerns Ng raises in the article, people have become even more motivated to find breeding methods that work well in most hobby situations.  The goal is for captive bred animals to become the standard, so no more crabs are collected from the wild for the pet trade.  This is similar to the movement one sees in the aquarist community - captive bred animals are considered better adapted to a captive environment, and endure much less stress than wild caught specimens that are then shipped thousands of miles.  In addition, people feel better knowing they are not contributing to the depletion of possibly threatened wild populations.  I see many similarities between this and the work done 1-2 decades ago to standardize domestic coral propagation to minimize the wild collection of coral.  I hope to see more work like this in the future, especially for salt water fish.\\n\\nGeosesarma hobbyists are also working to spread care and breeding best practices amongst themselves.  One occasionally sees these crabs sold as \"freshwater aquarium crabs\" - although they will survive, they will not thrive in an all-water environment.  Vivarium (all land) or paludarium (some land, some water) setups similar to those used for tropical frogs work best.  There\\'s quite an of overlap between the two hobbies, and decades of terrarium setup and care knowledge available from the frog crowd.  Using information available instead of trying to reinvent the wheel means that there are fairly decent care sheets available.  There is a small but enthusiastic Facebook group dedicated to Geosesarma care and breeding.  There\\'s also the occasional super-hobbyist (this one happens to be a biologist in his day job) who post their setups online.

       "              '156971': 'A Fine Mess: How Not to Assert Your Copyright in the Youtube Age by Vlad Savov [The Verge] A week ago, one of the more popular YouTube organizations, Fine Bros Entertainment, run by brothers Benny and Rafi Fine, announced a new scheme to license out its React brand and video format on a profit-sharing basis. Having developed a large audience through various series of reaction videos — where people are filmed as they react to watching or experiencing a new thing for the first time — they were now looking to apply the franchise model to their content. It was an offer for others to use the Fine Bros template for creating reaction videos, including series titles like Kids React and Elders React, and to ultimately be distributed and featured in front of the company’s large YouTube audience. The endeavor backfired spectacularly: partly because no one needed a template in the first place, but mostly because people felt that the Fine Bros were profiteering and aiming to exploit the creativity of others. Previously.\\n\\nRelated:\\n- YouTubers Revolt Over Licensing of Reaction Videos. [The Verge]\\nThe backlash to the Fine Bros\\' efforts has been swift and unforgiving. Their announcement video currently has nearly 240,000 thumbs down off 1.95 million views, and a subsequent video that tries to explain and clarify their intent has been slammed with 230,000 dislikes off 2.46 million views. Their unapologetic follow-up seems to indicate that the brothers believe it was simply a matter of \"confusion\" and poor communication, and there is some validity to their thinking. Many of the angriest reactions are conflating copyright with trademark law, and while it\\'s true that the Fine Bros are pursuing a trademark for \"React\" and other titles in their series, that doesn\\'t mean that they\\'ll own the entire genre — which, indeed, they claim not to want to do.\\n\\n- The Fine Brothers\\' Reaction Video Controversy, Explained. by Alex Abad-Santos [Vox]Watching the downfall of the YouTube celebrity duo known as the Fine Brothers has been kind of like watching someone get devoured by a crocodile — someone who\\'s kind of a jerk, whom you don\\'t like very much, and who jumped into the crocodile-infested river of his own volition. If there is a blueprint for how to get people on the internet to hate you, Rafi and Benny Fine wrote it. Earlier this week, the brothers attempted to trademark and monetize their brand of online reaction videos (more on these in a bit) and, somehow, completely underestimated how people would react. Citizen brigades bent on stopping the brothers sprang up on Reddit. Memes making fun of their physical appearance began circulating. People made reaction videos spoofing the Fines, and the brothers\\' YouTube follower count hemorrhaged. The Fine Brothers had become the internet\\'s greatest villains. And within a week, they nixed any plans of a trademark and apologized for their actions.\\n\\n- Why the Fine Brothers Are the Biggest Villains on the Internet Right Now by Ruth Reader [Tech Mic] The Fines applied for a trademark and not copyright. These are different classifications with different consequences. Trademarks are actually designed to protect the public, not creators. \"So when you buy a can of Pepsi, you know you\\'re gonna get that brown syrupy liquid — that\\'s what it\\'s designed to protect,\" media and entertainment attorney Rose Meade Hart tells Mic. \"It\\'s designed to protect me as the consumer, so I know what I\\'m getting because of the label on this jar.\" For instance, Kleenex, the tissue maker, and Xerox, the copy machine manufacturer, have trademarked their brands so that their product or services can\\'t be confused with those of with other tissue and copier manufacturers. But again, these trademarks were granted with the public in mind — not the brands — and they apply specifically to goods and services. Plus, trademarks are incredibly hard to get and keep, says Hart. \\n[*Many of the original videos posted by the Fine Brothers have since been taken down, but if you search YouTube, you should be able to find re-uploads, commentary and people reacting to their videos.]',\n",

He told her that her comment had violated our policy, but that he understood that there was a broader context (which to be clear, we were blissfully ignorant of until this weekend, and remain inexpert in.)\\n2.

Talking about what plagues us and what we can do better is not disparaging to ourselves, nor is it a direct attack on anyone else. Yet a whole lot of people in this conversation are calling themselves victims. Carl, like so many other men in online (and, let’s be honest, offline too) communities, cannot hear talk of something aimed at “marginalized voices” without feeling like his exclusion from that narrative means he’s now the real marginalized voice. He cannot hear a woman talk about abuse without feeling abused. He will go out of his way to harass and intimidate a woman and then cry persecution when she notices him. That’s as manipulative as it is pathetic. Good for Anita Sarkeesian for showing up in the first place to talk about such an awful, but pervasive and therefore necessary subject.

It sprang from student protests in Chile in 2011 over the perceived shortcomings of their lessons. A Chilean professor, Oscar Landerretche, worked with other economists to design a new curriculum. He, Sam Bowles, of the Santa Fe Institute, Wendy Carlin, of University College London (UCL), and Margaret Stevens, of Oxford University, painstakingly knitted contributions from economists around the world into a text that is free, online and offers interactive charts and videos of star economists. That text is the basis of economics modules taught by a small but growing number of instructors.\\n\\n“The Economy”, as the book is economically titled, covers the usual subjects, but in a very different way. It begins with the biggest of big pictures, explaining how capitalism and industrialisation transformed the world, inviting students to contemplate how it arrived at where it is today. Messy complications, from environmental damage to inequality, are placed firmly in the foreground. It explains cost curves, as other introductory texts do, but in the context of the Industrial Revolution, thus exposing students to debates about why industrialisation kicked off when and where it did. Thomas Malthus’s ideas are used to teach students the uses and limitations of economic models, combining technical instruction with a valuable lesson from the history of economic thought. “The Economy” does not dumb down economics; it uses maths readily, keeping students engaged through the topicality of the material. Quite early on, students have lessons in the weirdness in economics—from game theory to power dynamics within firms—that makes the subject fascinating and useful but are skimmed over in most introductory courses.\\n\\nTeaching the CORE curriculum feels like doing honest work, says Rajiv Sethi, of Barnard College, who contributed to the CORE textbook. Academic economists do not hide from students the complications they grapple with in their own research.\\nA New Way to Learn Economics - \"The CORE approach isn\\'t particularly radical. (Students looking for expositions of Marxian economics or Modern Monetary Theory will have to look elsewhere.) ... The CORE curriculum also takes economic history seriously... The text stresses that technical progress is the primary force driving economic growth. Citing the Yale economist William Nordhaus\\'s famous study of the development of electric lighting, it illustrates how standard economic statistics, such as the gross domestic product, sometimes fail to fully account for this progress.

She referred to him as \"nothing more than a damned Sputnik.\"\" You can hear him talk about the moment here.\\n\\nMental Floss: \\nIn a segregated Memphis, Monroe was looking to make news and fill seats at Ellis Auditorium. The difference between “Sputnik” and other pro wrestlers of the era was that he welcomed—and eventually insisted—that his black fans sit wherever they chose.\\n\\nIn living out his ring persona on racially divisive streets, Monroe was about to single-handedly desegregate public venues. While wearing only his underpants.\\n\\n\\nMonroe knew he held the power of the purse--literally. As he saw it, \"\\'There used to be a couple of thousand blacks outside wanting in. So I would tell management I’d be cutting out if they don’t let my black friends in. I had the power because I’m selling out the place, the first guy that ever did, and they damn sure wanted the revenue.\\'” (Note: Read the comments for lots of memories of Sputnik.) \\n\\nHis best-known match was probably a 1959 bout with Billy Wicks, \"as a small but tough blue collar appealing character [and t]he perfect foil to the glamor boy image of Gorgeous George.\" Their fight set a record in Memphis, drawing a greater attendance than Elvis Presley had at the city\\'s Rosswood Park three years earlier. (Upon a return visit to the city in 1988, Monroe said \"I get kissed by people on Beale Street who didn\\'t see me wrestle. They heard from their parents or grandparents what I had done and thanked me for doing it. That\\'s pretty emotional, to have people walk up on the street and hug you and tell you ‘thank you\\' for something you did 40 years ago. Its he** to see the toughest son of a b**ch in the world cry when that happens.\")\\n\\nHis career made for uneasy relationships at home as well: \"According to Sputnik\\'s Memphis-born son, chip-off-the-old turnbuckle Quentin Brumbaugh, better known as professional wrestler \"Bubba Monroe, the Cajun Brawler,\"...\"Mamma had our name changed to her maiden name, Bell,\" he said, out of fear for the family. Then, he said, she moved them back to Louisiana....Because of Sputnik\\'s \"negro\" relationships, \"My grandfather would not sit at the table and eat a meal with him,\" said Natalie Bell, 57, Sputnik\\'s daughter and a nurse practitioner in Tucson, Arizona.\"\\n\\nAfter retiring from wrestling, he went on to a quieter life as a security guard and a shuttle bus driver. His health declined; he had half a lung removed, and fought his way through bouts with prostate cancer, gall bladder surgery and gangrene.\\n\\nSputnik Monroe died in his sleep at age 77, on Nov. 3, 2006.

The main transfer mechanism is land and housing costs, as rising rents and evictions push service and other low-wage workers to the brink. [Henry] George\\'s solution was a single land tax that would replace all other government revenue sources. If an owner wanted to develop their property to make it more useful or productive, George argued that they should have the right to keep the value from those efforts. But increases in the value of underlying land were created by — and ultimately belonged to — the public at large.\" (previously: 1,2,3)Because no one could create land, it would be impossible to tax it out of existence. In contrast, property taxes disincentivize people from using land more productively, since re-developing land leads to higher re-assessments. A century later, Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz would prove out a Henry George theorem, showing that in certain cases increased investment in public goods boosted land rents by at least that much. This suggests that land taxes alone could be enough to sustain public or government expenditures. Milton Friedman would call them the “least bad tax,” while Karl Marx called George’s ideas “capitalist’s last ditch” with a hint of friendly contempt.\\n\\nGeorge would publish these ideas in his seminal work “Progress and Poverty,”[pdf] which would go on to sell several million copies and kick off the Progressive Era. “Progress and Poverty” captured the zeitgeist of the times. The parallels between the late 19th century Gilded Age, named after a Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner novel about a speculative land deal gone awry, and the modern era are striking...\\n\\nA missing piece of [Carlota] Perez’s work, that often goes underemphasized by the private investment community, is the role of government in creating an equitable framework that allows everyone to participate in benefits of technological change. This is not an argument in favor of big government for big government’s sake; it’s to point out that when technology changes the complexity or structure of society, citizens have to push public institutions to transform themselves too.\\n\\n“Golden ages are not brought by markets alone,” Perez told me. “Historically, they have never done it.” If Perez is right, the polarization and disillusionment obvious in the 2016 presidential primaries through the rise of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump is just the beginning of something else. Broad institutional and governmental change is what the Gilded Age triggered in the ensuing Progressive Era. George’s ideas would echo for many decades and influenced an entire generation of leaders from Leo Tolstoy to Sun Yat Sen to George Bernard Shaw.\\nA Long Game - \"A new generational land cartel has emerged with Californian Baby Boomers protecting entitlements and higher property values for themselves in the form of land-use restrictions and Proposition 13. Global capital has been subverting and taking advantage of these favorable legal and taxation protections on real estate in a extremely low interest-rate world. All of this has come at the cost of the state\\'s working and middle class and its future workforce.\"\\n\\nHome is where the cartel is - \"Homeowners understand their actions not as monopolizing the housing market but as protecting their homes and neighborhoods from the market. The libertarian \\'deregulatory\\' rhetoric by which market urbanists sometimes make their case is counterproductive.\"[1,2]\\n\\nalso btw...\\nRed Vienna lives - \"A unique system nearly a century in the making has created a situation today in which the city government of Vienna either owns or directly influences almost half the housing stock  in the capital city. As a result, residents enjoy high-quality apartments with inexpensive rent, along with renters\\' rights that would be unheard of in the U.S. Viennese have decided that housing is a human right so important that it shouldn\\'t be left up to the free market.\"\\nWhat\\'s happened to U.S. housing inequality? - \"Over the past year or so, economists have been paying more attention to the role of housing in economic inequality in the United States. Many have pointed to the value of housing as the prime reason for the decline in the share of income going to labor. Research by Matt Rognlie of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology finds that the increase in the share of income going to capital since 1948 has gone entirely to housing... it looks as though the main driver of the rise in the housing inequality is the value that people are putting on different neighborhoods. Increased housing segregation seems to be the main culprit, as the rich decide to use their increased income to live in rich neighborhoods, which in turn increases housing inequality.\"\\nAre Economists in Denial About What\\'s Driving the Inequality Trainwreck? - \"You may see a lot of towers owned by new billionaires along Manhattan\\'s 57th street, but real estate is not the major contributor to wealth inequality. Rather, in Manhattan, the Bay area, London, and similar places, incredibly expensive real estate is a symptom of wealth that has been accumulated by other means.\"\\nYour Landlord Is a Drag on Growth - \"After many decades of essentially ignoring the role of land, economists are starting to reconsider. Some are worried that landlords are hurting growth by making it too expensive to live in highly productive cities. Now, some are starting to think about how land figures in the rise in inequality.\"\\nThe New Exclusionary Zoning - \"If low-income families can\\'t afford the suburbs and the cities, where should they go? For the first time in American history, it makes sense to talk about whole regions of the country \"gentrifying\"—whole metropolitan areas whose high housing costs have rendered them inhospitable to low-income families, who, along with solidly middle class families, also feeling the crunch, have been paying higher housing costs or migrating to low-housing cost (and low-wage) areas like Texas, Arizona, or North Carolina. Underlying both of these phenomena—high housing costs in the suburbs and high housing costs in the cities—is a relatively straightforward problem of supply and demand. A city\\'s ability to remain affordable depends most crucially on its ability to expand housing supply in the face of increased demand. Among the people who care most about high housing costs there is a lack of understanding of the main causes and the policy approaches that can address them. The central message of this Article is that the housing advocacy community—from the shoe-leather organizer to the academic theoretician—needs to abandon its reflexively anti-development sentiments and embrace an agenda that accepts and advocates for increased housing development of all types as a way to blunt rising housing costs in the country\\'s most expensive markets.\"\\nHow technological innovation can massively reduce the cost of living - \"Part of the cost of shelter is the land, and part is the cost of the building. Putting aside, at least for purposes of this article, fanciful schemes to create more land, the amount of land available is approximately fixed. This means that there are three ways to reduce the cost of shelter: 1) build more densely (i.e., share expensive land between more households), 2) reduce the cost of construction, and 3) make currently cheap and underutilized land more accessible and useful.\"\\nSupply and demand still works - \"Build more housing and rents fall. Rents in Seattle, Denver, and Washington, DC appear to be easing significantly. In what a local business paper describes as an \\'alarming deterioration\\'—though renters probably have different words for it—the average Seattle rent fell by $59 in the last quarter of 2015, following a long period of rapid increases. Not coincidentally, vacancies also increased by a full percentage point.\"\\nThe Steady Rise of Renting - \"In the aftermath of the economic crisis, renters have been caught in a devastating bind as rents have risen while incomes decline. Average rents increased by 22.3 percent between 2006 to 2014, while average incomes declined by 5.8 percent.\"\\nWhere Sprawl Makes It Tougher to Rise Up the Social Ranks - \"Dense metros tend to offer more economic opportunity than less compact cities do.\"\\nHappiness Tip of the Day: Ditch the Commute - \"One final point: behavioral economics tells us that we quickly get used to big houses but we never get used to commuting. So when you have a choice, go for the smaller house closer to work.\"',\n",

Club] “There’s a horrible reality underneath all the blood and bombast of Shadow Of War: When you “dominate” an orc, you are erasing its agency and enslaving it. There’s really no two ways around it. The notion that this entire game is built upon the act of removing another living thing’s will and using them as an object is an unsettling truth that you’re forced to confront over and over again. Sometimes it’s not enough to brainwash your enemy. Sometimes you also have to explode your allies’ heads or steal their life like the miserable vampire you are. Sometimes the people around you will question your methods, pointing out that the Ring Of Power enabling your domination has been used time and again to deceive and corrupt others and that its use never ends well for the wearer. [...]  The game clearly wants you to think about what you’ve spent dozens of hours doing, or at the very least, it’s finally accepted the fact that there’s really no escaping the hypocrisy and ugliness of its entire conceit.”• \\'Shadow of Mordor\\' is morally repulsive and I can\\'t stop playing it [The Verge] “Stalking, torturing, terrorizing, and assassinating Uruks is cruel and malicious, and the game sometimes acknowledges as much, calling your actions into question with bits of dialogue. But all internal criticism feels superficial alongside literally dozens of hours of instilling fear into the hearts of my enemies with my bow and sword. And to be clear, you torture in this game: You have the option to beat an enemy within an inch of his life, and only at that point will he reveal information or switch loyalties out of fear. That is torture. Later in the game, your character unlocks the ability to send beaten Uruks as threats to their superiors, and also the option to enslave Uruks, to have them fight alongside you — until you tap a button that kills them all. It\\'s an odd twist, considering scattered throughout the game up to this point are optional missions to save human slaves from Uruk masters.”\\n\\n• Orc Slavery Made Me Quit ‘Middle-earth: Shadow of War’ [Motherboard] “He found me. I was hiding in a bush and there he was. He called to his fellow orcs, said he smelled manflesh and pulled me out of hiding. After he tossed me to the ground, he told me he was older than the dirt below me and (once again) mentioned that he\\'d never die. Fair enough. I beat him down, broke his will, and made him my personal bodyguard. Later, he gave his life yet again protecting me in battle. And then he came back to life. I was on my way to start another quest when he found me again. He wasn\\'t the orc I\\'d fallen in love with, but a twisted wreck. His body bore the scars of his recent deaths. The bone galea was gone, replaced by a wrought iron mask enshrining his broken features. Stitches criss-crossed the limbs he lost in his most recent battle. Someone had sewn him back together. He was furious with me for leaving him behind, for forcing him to fight and die, for using him so badly. We clashed, I won and I reached into his mind to pull him back into my fold but he resisted. So I killed him. Again. Hours later, he found me.”\\n\\n• Shadow of War’s Treatment of Orcs is the Worst Part of the Game [Game Revolution] “As you play through the game, you\\'ll fight and \"dominate\" a ton of orc captains, and each one of them has their own randomly generated traits and personality. If not for the dynamic nature of the NPCs the Shadow of War would get repetitive quickly, but seeing how the next captain will look, talk, and how they\\'ll fight keeps the experience fresh. The most important thing the Nemesis System does though is to emotionally invest you in the soldiers that make up your army. You\\'ll inevitably have your favorites, and you\\'ll worry about them when they have to fight. Why then, if the game spends so much time getting you involved with the orcs, does Talion and Celebrimbor treat them like garbage the whole game? [...] For the most part, the only comments Talion and Celebrimbor have to make about the orcs is how they\\'re disgusting, but useful creatures. Never is it brought to the forefront that what you\\'re doing for the whole game is akin to slavery.”\\n\\n• You can make orcs fight like Pokémon in Middle-earth: Shadow of War [PC Gamer] “To prepare for that big battle, I commanded one of my orcs to fight the bodyguard orc of one of the war chiefs. If your orc defeats this bodyguard, Shadow of War gives them the opportunity to become a spy, and ambush that war chief if and when you go to fight them. But these \"Infiltration\" missions have a catch: you can\\'t participate. It\\'s a contest between two orcs to see who\\'s the better fighter, and see who deserves the job of bodyguard more. Now that I\\'ve played a little more, I\\'ve also discovered an area called the Fight Pits, where you can essentially level-grind your orcs against one another or enemies. On my first Infiltration mission, I sent in secret agent Stakûga the Molten against an unknown orc in the video above, hoping that his flaming spear and non-flaming shield would be enough. Infiltrations are timed fights, and you can move the camera around a little, but otherwise have zero control over the outcome. I watched with trepidation as Stakûga absorbed a few shield bashes early in the fight, becoming dazed. I don\\'t have kids, but I feel like in this moment I understood why some parents lose their minds at recreational children\\'s sports games.”',\n",

While the Sammo Hung production isn\\'t the first Hong Kong comedy horror fighting film to feature a jiangshi, or hopping corpses or vampires of Chinese folklore, it\\'s the one that created a franchise and inspired numerous sequels and tributes. As a successful special effects driven 80’s comedy, it is often compared to Ghostbusters, but, you know, with martial arts. Let\\'s dive into the world of Chinese folklore in HK comedy horror!As noted by Kung Fu Kingdom, Encounters of the Spooky Kind (YT, trailer) was the first major jiangshi-featuring film, and may have had some superior fight scenes, but it was Mr. Vampire (Veoh, full movie with English subs) that really started the jiangshi-based film (and television) genre. \\n\\nMr. Vampire has one \"canonical\" sequel, Mr. Vampire 1992 (Dailymotion, English movie summary and review), and three other sequels that aren\\'t related to the first film, but follow the same themes: Mr. Vampire II (Veoh), Mr. Vampire III (Dailymotion, part 1, part 2), and Mr. Vampire IV (Veoh). But if you\\'re looking to get any sort of connection from this \"series,\" don\\'t bother -- they\\'re connected in name only, as some don\\'t even feature any jiangshi (review of the 5 Mr. Vampire films). \\n\\nThen there are more Chinese vampire genre films featuring the unibrowed Taoist exorcist played by Lam Ching-ying, including Encounters of the Spooky Kind II (1990 - YT trailer, no subtitles), Magic Cop [aka Mr. Vampire 5] (1990 - YT, full movie with English subs), and Vampire Vs. Vampire (1989 - Veoh, full movie with English subs), which was directed by Lam himself. Lam was even featured in the two-season series Vampire Expert (Youtube playlist. That series may have continued career into another season, except he developed liver cancer and died before the project was completed. My Date with a Vampire, a series that started in 1998, was initially dedicated to Lam.\\n\\nSpeaking of spin-offs and tributes, there are games! Let\\'s start with the NES game, Reigen Doushi (Japanese, longplay on YouTube), which was released as Phantom Fighter (ROM emulated online) in the US. And if you\\'re more of a board game geek, there are a number of Mr. Vampire-related Japanese board games.\\n\\nIf you really want to expand your jiangshi movie playlist, Wikipedia has a limited list, which is notable for connecting two thematic sequels: jiangshi and The Gods Must Be Crazy (previously).

       "              '168182': 'Canadian researchers reconstituted an extinct poxvirus for $100,000 using mail-order DNA Sciencemag: Virologists synthesized the extinct horsepox - harmless to humans - by combining genetic material ordered by mail.David Evans, lead on the project, hopes the research will \"will help unravel the origins of a centuries-old smallpox vaccine and lead to new, better vaccines or even cancer therapeutics\".\\n\\nWhat are those mysterious origins? The standard story of Edward Jenner and his vaccine involved cowpox, but there are hints that the virus used was horsepox instead. And although Jenner deserves immense respect for his work, he didn\\'t dream the idea from nothing. Before vaccines there was variolation: using smallpox scabs and pus to introduce the germ. It was dangerous, and people died, but at profoundly lower rates than those who suffered the disease by contagion. \\n\\nChina has the oldest documented use with medical records explaining the practice dating back to the 15th century, and similar practices were also used in the Middle East and Africa. African slaves introduced the medical procedure to America. Cotton Mather learned about the practice from his slave, Onesimus, and it was used during a smallpox epidemic in Boston in 1721.  At the same time, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was popularizing the practice in Britain and then throughout England after learning of it during her stay in Istanbul. \\n\\nSome Americans and Europeans resisted variolation, some terrified of any contact with smallpox, others condemning it as against the will of God. (Not that that stopped America from using it as a weapon.) Jenner\\'s vaccination was, by contrast, remarkably safe, and further revolutionized medical science. Still: we must consider the women who provided this medicine, who knew about it and taught the knowledge and saved countless lives. \\n\\nThose were saved lives amongst many, many loss. Smallpox was a global scourge and one of the most feared diseases, with outbreaks dating back to, at minimum, 3000 BC. It killed millions, altered wars, changed the course of history, and caused untold suffering. But we get to say this in past-tense: we wiped out smallpox as a contagious disease. From variolation to vaccine to a world-wide campaign, no one suffers now. It is one of the most remarkable achievements of humankind - comparable, Donald Henderson said, to landing on the moon. (Previously.)\\n\\nThat\\'s careful wording. Although the contagion has stopped smallpox still exists, and here\\'s where this interesting horsepox experiment gets a little unnerving. When in 1980 the WHO confirmed smallpox outbreaks were officially over, the question arose: do we keep this virus around? Was the scientific knowledge worth the danger? There are now only two locations where variola virus is officially stored and handled under WHO supervision: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR Institute) in Koltsovo, Russia. Locked away safely, except for the occasional lost box (previously) or the tons and tons of smallpox made (definitely) and destroyed (allegedly) by American and Russian scientists during the Cold War.\\n\\nAs quite a bit of smallpox was produced and both the virus\\'s destination - and that of the well-educated but poorly-paid scientists after the collapse of the Soviet Union - is hinted at darkly but fairly unknown, it\\'s been a bugbear of those who are wary of a bioterrorism or biowarfare attack with the \"oldie moldies\". Proponents of public health readiness warn that germ warfare is as devastating as a nuclear attack but a lot cheaper and a lot easier to pull off.\\n\\nWe can reassure ourselves that such an attack with smallpox would have to involve contact with those who had access to the original stockpiles - but this scientific breakthrough is an interesting potential change. WHO observed that Evans\\'s effort \"did not require exceptional biochemical knowledge or skills, significant funds or significant time.\" \"No question. If it’s possible with horsepox, it’s possible with smallpox,\" virologist Gerd Sutter stated.\\n\\nWe still have vaccines around. But as we think about dual-use research, scientific access, health insurance, or government reactions, consider public health: that often overlooked but life-saving emergency monitoring and reacting system that keeps us safe from the stomach flu and smallpox.\\n\\nFurther reading on public health, smallpox, and germ warfare might include:\\nThe Coming Plague by Laurie Garrett\\nBetryal of Trust by Laurie Garrett\\nDemon in the Freezer by Richard Preston\\nInside the Outbreaks by Mark Pendergrast\\nOn Immunity: An Inoculation by Eula Biss\\nThe Biology of Doom by Ed Regis\\n\\nAnd Smallpox and its Eradication, free online from the WHO.',\n",

It\\'s one of ten instruments  aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite that measure chemical and physical processes in Earth\\'s upper atmosphere. To find factors that would cause peaks in airglow and create bright nights, the researchers ruled out meteors and aurora, which have their own distinct signatures.\\n\\nSolving the Centuries-old Mystery of Rare ‘Bright Nights’:\\n\\nUltraviolet radiation from the sun interacts with oxygen molecules in the atmosphere on a regular basis, occasionally splitting them into negatively charged oxygen ions. When these ions meet each other again and recombine, the reaction gives off energy in the form of visible light.\\n\\nThis reaction is called airglow, and it’s something that researchers have been measuring for well over a century with specialized instruments. It often appears in pictures from the International Space Station, manifesting as a thin green curve hovering above the surface of Earth. The faint gleam isn’t all that rare —the authors estimate that it’s occurring somewhere around the planet about seven percent of the time — but airglow is normally invisible to us down here on the surface, as it is too faint to see.\\n\\nBut on rare occasions airglow lights up the night sky due to the “stacking” of high-altitude atmospheric waves, which can multiply the intensity by a factor of 10. When the wave frequencies align, their amplitudes increase, and when up to four of them combine at a certain longitude, the night sky comes alive.',\n",

Since the late 15th century, however, the transaction costs of long-distance trade increased as a result of growing exclusivity and formalization efforts in the Hanseatic league.

       "              '168181': \"Hollow Knight's Charming Art Sets the Bar for Hand Drawn Games [PC Gamer] “I've been obsessed with indie metroidvania Hollow Knight [Release Trailer] [Beneath and Beyond Trailer] since its launch late last month. Apart from having fun and challenging combat and a massive amount of game to explore, I've found myself sucked in by the moody, Dark Souls-inspired setting developer Team Cherry has created. Despite a mostly monotone dark color palette, the dank corridors of Hallownest still feel vibrant thanks to how Hollow Knight mixes fantastic hand drawn art with more modern effects. It's a lot of little things all coming together that make Hollow Knight look so good, many of which you may not actively notice. It's a 2D game with 2D animations, but Team Cherry's use of dynamic lighting, shadows, and particle effects do a huge amount of work to solidify those 2D sketches and make them feel real in whatever space they're in. And while the character designs are relatively clean and simple, animation fills them with personality. ”• Hollow from the Other Side, I Must Have Died a Thousand Times [Destructoid] “Speaking of not being spoon fed, Hollow Knight encourages you to go explore as you wish. Most areas of the map are accessible early on, with certain areas in them only being accessible after acquiring items and abilities elsewhere. This meant that by the time I'd reached the credits for the first time, which took me 27 well-spent hours, I was pretty comfortable navigating most of the kingdom without looking at my map. Backtracking to areas I'd been never felt tedious. Along the way I'd be killing enemies to collect Geo, the in-game currency, as well as discovering previously unreachable areas and secrets, including a slew of challenging bosses. Bosses aren't pushovers, even with grinding to get some of the better equipment to help out. Reflexes are definitely put to the test, especially considering most bosses are unique in their move sets, meaning each of the 30 boss battles provide a whole new challenge to overcome. Players that get frustrated easily might be turned off by some of the difficulty, but I never found any of the bosses to be unfair in their tactics.”\\n\\n• Hollow Knight is Full of Bugs [Metro] “Like all Metroidvanias, you start out with very little in the way of equipment, weapons, or abilities and must instead earn them as you progress. So while you’re free to explore the game world however you want, many areas will be inaccessible until you have the proper tools to do so. Hollow Knight makes things more difficult than usual though, by refusing to give you any map or compass to point you in the right direction. Instead you have to buy maps from friendly bugs and work out your own plan for exploration. Hollow Knight is not an easy game, but despite the parallels with Dark Souls et al. it’s not punishingly hard to the same degree. Death can come quickly during combat but it’s fast and enjoyable, with a great sense of impact courtesy of the excellent animation and sound effects. The boss battles are particularly good, with a wide variety in enemy designs and the techniques needed to defeat them. The platform design is generally good too, although the overreliance on a difficult-to-pull-off downward slash is the game’s most consistent point of frustration.”\\n\\n• Hollow Knight Feels Too Familiar, Despite Being a Solid Metroidvania [Rock Paper Shotgun] “I began by alluding to its weaknesses and perhaps now I name them you’ll take umbrage. Hollow Knight takes core features of the genre and then tries to tell you they’re special. Like, perhaps at its most egregious, your position on a map. Maps are tricky enough here, with new zones not possible to even map as you explore them – you have to buy or find a pre-created map to even bring up the map screen for an area, and then fill in the dotted lines of where you’ve yet to explore. Quite why your character can’t know that they just walked down a path and went left I’m not sure, but that’s how it is. You can spend long stretches aimlessly stumbling around until you find your way out. But on top of this, to see where your character is on a map when you have one is considered a feature, a special ability gained by purchasing it from a shop and then using one of your precious ability slots to implement it. A basic standard of the genre, locked up behind a purchase and a skill use. So, so weird. So rather than enjoying a burgeoning pool of abilities, you’re restricted to however many ability slots you have, and choosing between them.”\\n\\n• Watch Me Map 30 hours of Metroidvania Exploration in 30 Seconds [PC Gamer] “It has an intricate and massive map, full of gated areas and secrets hidden behind tantalizing gaps just a bit too wide to jump.  But as the game goes on, new movement abilities break that sprawling city wide open. As games like this often do, dead ends suddenly become new paths, and gaining something as simple as a double jump means countless pits can now be cleared. Countless, that is, unless you count them. Which I did.  About six hours into my 35 hour playthrough of Hollow Knight, I started to lose track of all the places I'd been. I had so many different paths I could follow, that finding a new movement ability mostly meant struggling to remember all the places I could use it. So, inspired partly by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's map, I started to take notes on a custom map of my own in Adobe Photoshop. Across 30 hours of Hollow Knight, here is what the evolution of that map looks like.”\\n\\n• Hollow Knight (Original Soundtrack) by Christopher Larkin [Bandcamp] “Beneath the fading town of Dirtmouth sleeps an ancient, forgotten kingdom. Many are drawn beneath the surface, searching for riches, or glory, or answers to old secrets. Descend into Hallownest, traverse the depths, unravel its mysteries and conquer its evils.  The score for Hollow Knight captures the vast underground world of the game. The story begins with soft piano notes echoing the Hollow Knight theme, and as the player explores further, orchestral forces swell to an operatic scale as the fate of the knight unfolds.”\",\n",

The brochures got their iconic look by none other than the acclaimed designer Massimo Vignelli, who is perhaps best known for designing New York’s subway signage and a subway map that made New Yorkers scratch their heads during the 1970s. Vignelli’s Helvetica-helmed Unigrid design is so iconic that it’s even in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art—not bad for a deceptively simple brochure.\\nsmithsonian.com | May 9, 2016\\n\\nInterview: Matt Holly of NPMaps\\nModern Hiker | July 15, 2016\\n\\nWhat Makes A Map Beautiful, According To A Parks Ranger\\nFast Company Co.Design | June 28, 2016',\n",

       "              '157046': 'In the wake of the sequencing of the human genome in the early 2000s, genome pioneers and social scientists alike called for an end to the use of race as a variable in genetic research. Unfortunately, by some measures, the use of race as a biological category has increased in the postgenomic age. Although inconsistent definition and use has been a chief problem with the race concept, it has historically been used as a taxonomic categorization based on common hereditary traits (such as skin color) to elucidate the relationship between our ancestry and our genes. We believe the use of biological concepts of race in human genetic research—so disputed and so mired in confusion—is problematic at best and harmful at worst. It is time for biologists to find a better way. - An editorial in Science exploring the conundrum facing genomic researchers where race is both fundamentally flawed as a scientific model and violently dangerous but still the only consistent lens through which study participants understand the information they have about their own connection to human diversityWhat we do and don\\'t know about \\'race\\', \\'ethnicity\\', genetics and health at the dawn of the genome era - Francis S Collins\\nA true understanding of disease risk requires a thorough examination of root causes. \\'Race\\' and \\'ethnicity\\' are poorly defined terms that serve as flawed surrogates for multiple environmental and genetic factors in disease causation, including ancestral geographic origins, socioeconomic status, education and access to health care. Research must move beyond these weak and imperfect proxy relationships to define the more proximate factors that influence health.\\n\\nThe Informationalization of Race: Communication Technologies and the Human Genome in the Digital Age - Peter A. Chow-White\\nThis paper suggests that a new form of racialization is being produced in the information age through developments and innovations in communication technologies. Increasingly, racial knowledge is being constructed from seemingly neutral and unrelated pieces of information, which are collected, sorted, and analyzed through two key technologies: databases and the Internet. I call this interaction between technology and identity the \"informationalization of race.\" As a mode of representation, a structuring device, and as a biological category, race is undergoing a significant transformation in the digital age. I ground this concept in a case study of the next Human Genome Project — the HapMap Project — to understand how technologies are being shaped in a specific institutional setting. Advances in human genomics have recently re-invigorated scientific research into the relationship between race and biology. Where the HGP concluded that humanity is similar at the genetic level, the HapMap Project began by looking for differences between white, African, and Asian groups. It\\'s anticipated that promising findings from the HapMap project will be of help in developing pharmaceuticals that can target common diseases, such as cancer. However, this development also opens the door to old biological conceptions of race and a new phase of the biopolitics of the human body. \\n\\nEvidence for Gradients of Human Genetic Diversity Within and Among Continents - David Serre\\nGenetic variation in humans is sometimes described as being discontinuous among continents or among groups of individuals, and by some this has been interpreted as genetic support for “races.” A recent study in which >350 microsatellites were studied in a global sample of humans showed that they could be grouped according to their continental origin, and this was widely interpreted as evidence for a discrete distribution of human genetic diversity. Here, we investigate how study design can influence such conclusions. Our results show that when individuals are sampled homogeneously from around the globe, the pattern seen is one of gradients of allele frequencies that extend over the entire world, rather than discrete clusters. Therefore, there is no reason to assume that major genetic discontinuities exist between different continents or “races.”\\n\\nCommentary: Considerations for Use of Racial/Ethnic Classification in Etiologic Research - Jay S. Kaufman and Richard S. Cooper\\nNumerous authors have critiqued the use of race as an etiologic quantity in medical research. Despite this criticism, the use of variables encoding racial/ethnic categorization has increased in epidemiology, and most researchers agree that important variation in disease risk is captured by this classification system. Previous discussions have generally neglected to articulate guidelines for appropriate use of racial/ethnic information in etiologic research. The authors summarize the logical, conceptual, and practical problems associated with the “ethnic paradigm” as currently applied in biomedical sciences and offer a set of methodological recommendations toward more valid use of racial/ethnic classification in etiologic studies. These suggested guidelines address issues of variable definition, study design, and covariate control, providing a consistent foundation for etiologic research programs that neither ignore racial/ethnic disease disparities nor obfuscate the nature of these disparities through inappropriate analytical approaches. This methodological analysis of racial/ethnic classification as an epidemiologic quantity provides a formal basis for a focus on racism (i.e., social relations) rather than race (i.e., innate biologic predisposition) in the interpretation of racial/ethnic “effects.”\\n\\nGenes, race and research ethics: who’s minding the store? - LM Hunt and MS Megyesi\\nBackground: The search for genetic variants between racial/ethnic groups to explain differential disease susceptibility and drug response has provoked sharp criticisms, challenging the appropriateness of using race/ethnicity as a variable in genetics research, because such categories are social constructs and not biological classifications.\\nObjectives: To gain insight into how a group of genetic scientists conceptualise and use racial/ethnic variables in their work and their strategies for managing the ethical issues and consequences of this practice.\\nMethods: In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 30 genetic researchers who use racial/ethnic variables in their research. Standard qualitative methods of content analysis were used.\\nResults: Most of the genetic researchers viewed racial/ethnic variables as arbitrary and very poorly defined, and in turn as scientifically inadequate. However, most defended their use, describing them as useful proxy variables on a road to “imminent medical progress”. None had developed overt strategies for addressing these inadequacies, with many instead asserting that science will inevitably correct itself and saying that meanwhile researchers should “be careful” in the language chosen for reporting findings.\\nConclusions: While the legitimacy and consequences of using racial/ethnic variables in genetics research has been widely criticised, ethical oversight is left to genetic researchers themselves. Given the general vagueness and imprecision we found amongst these researchers regarding their use of these variables, they do not seem well equipped for such an undertaking. It would seem imperative that research ethicist move forward to develop specific policies and practices to assure the scientific integrity of genetic research on biological differences between population groups.\\n\\nThe Standardization of Race and Ethnicity in Biomedical Science Editorials and UK Biobanks - Andrew Smart, Richard Tutton, Paul Martin, George T.H. Ellison and Richard Ashcroft\\nAs the search for human genetic variation has become a priority for biomedical science, debates have resurfaced about the use of race and ethnicity as scientific classifications. In this paper we consider the relationship between race, ethnicity and genetics, using insights from science and technology studies (STS) about processes of classification and standardization. We examine how leading biomedical science journals attempted to standardize the classifications of race and ethnicity, and analyse how a sample of UK genetic scientists used the concepts in their research. Our content analysis of 11 editorials and related guidelines reveals variations in the guidance on offer, and it appears that there has been a shift from defining the concepts to prescribing methodological processes for classification. In qualitative interviews with 17 scientists, the majority reported that they had adopted socio-political classification schemes from state bureaucracy (for example, the UK Census) for practical reasons, although some scientists used alternative classifications that they justified on apparently methodological grounds. The different responses evident in the editorials and interviews can be understood as reflecting the balance of flexibility and stability that motivate standardization processes. We argue that, although a genetic concept of race and ethnicity is unlikely to wholly supplant a socio-political one, the adoption of census classifications into biomedical research is an alignment of state bureaucracy and science that could have significant consequences.',\n",

       "              '168083': 'The Making of Final Fantasy 12 [Polygon] “Controversy trails behind the Final Fantasy series with each new release. From cries of betrayal when Final Fantasy 7 jumped ship to PlayStation to frustration over the story changes Final Fantasy 15 underwent during its tortuous 10-year development process, there\\'s simply no such thing as an easy birth when it comes to Square Enix\\'s biggest franchise. Final Fantasy 12, the 2006 PlayStation release whose overhauled high-definition remake The Zodiac Age launches July 11, may well have been the most tortuous release of all. Arriving years late and abandoning numerous established series traditions in favor of a radically overhauled play style, FF12 immediately inspired ardent enthusiasm and passionate hatred among the series\\' faithful, with seemingly little room in between.”• Final Fantasy 12 Devs Explain Why It\\'s Re-emerging After 11 Years [Gamespot] “Several reasons, but since we worked on the original XII, we have a lot of memories associated with that title. And when Final Fantasy X came out as an HD remaster on the PS4 and became a successful title, we thought that maybe we should bring this one back as well. So we brought together the core members of the original development team. And then another reason was that when we created the original XII, we actually made it relatively high spec. So we were always thinking that we wanted to create an HD version of it sometime in the future. But if we did that, I wanted to have the original members work on it as well. It was difficult trying to find a time when everyone could work together again, just because everyone was on different projects. When we released the original, it was around when the PS2 was changing into the new generation of PS3s. So we really utilized the PS2 system to its fullest, to the maximum. The mechanic that we had in there, called the Gambit System, was very unique. There were no other games that had that kind of system at that time. So with the unique game system and world that we created in XII, I believe it left a strong memory inside of people.”\\n\\n• Is Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age the blueprint for renovating old games? [Ars Technica] “Rather than simply release FFXII with the usual HD makeover, Square Enix has opted for a more robust reincarnation of the classic RPG. The hope is that, on both a technical and interactive level, The Zodiac Age remains as relevant now as it was when it received its slew of accolades back in 2006 (FFXII holds a 92 percent rating on Metacritic). In an oddly counterintuitive approach to modernisation, Square Enix has enlisted the help of the team behind the original release. \"There have been discussions within Square Enix for quite some time regarding whether we wanted to do a remaster of Final Fantasy XII and how we might go about doing it,\" producer Hiroaki Kato says during a chat in Square Enix’s London office, which also features game director Takashi Kitano, a translator, and a selection of company representatives from the UK and Japan. It\\'s an unusually large number of people to wheel out for re-release—clearly, Square Enix isn\\'t taking any chances.”\\n\\n• Final Fantasy XII Is Way Better Than I Remembered [Kotaku] “If you haven’t played Final Fantasy XII, you should know two things. One is that it’s an Ivalice game, which means it looks and feels a lot like Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story, and (especially) Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2. There are certain trends to be found in every game by director Yasumi Matsuno, who left FFXII midway through production but whose hands were clearly all over this thing. From the major (a convoluted, Game of Thrones-y plot with lots of politics and backstabbing) to the minor (status effects called Brave and Faith), all of the Matsuno tropes are in here. The second thing you should know is that Final Fantasy XII’s core gameplay is like no other role-playing game out there. It’s sort of like an MMORPG, except you control all of the characters. Instead of cycling through a party of three or four heroes and giving them all orders, you can plan things out in advance, using a mechanic called the Gambit System that allows you to put on your programmer’s hat and write some if statements. You might tell your tank to attack any enemy she sees, or tell your healer to cast Cura on any character whose hit points fall below 40%. You can experiment with these Gambits in creative ways. The more abilities your characters get, the more fun it is to try to transform them into an automated death squad.”\\n\\n• Hands On: Final Fantasy XII on PS4 Is a Strong Reminder of How Great the Series Used to Be [Push Square] “Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is an eye-opener. Playing it 11 years after its original PlayStation 2 release has made us realise just how ahead of its time the game was back in 2006. Unlike Final Fantasy X - which also received the remaster treatment not too long ago on PlayStation 3, Vita, and PlayStation 4 - XII, for the most part, has aged shockingly well. So much of the release still holds up; the twisting narrative puts the series\\' more recent attempts to shame, the world of Ivalice is fantastical yet intriguingly grounded, and gameplay-wise, the title remains incredibly cohesive. The Zodiac Age is a poignant reminder of just how brilliant Final Fantasy used to be. And that\\'s not really us having a pop at Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XV - two games that aren\\'t all that bad as far as we\\'re concerned - but it is clear that Square\\'s property once had a magic touch that it\\'s gradually let slip away over the years. We\\'re around 20 hours into The Zodiac Age and we find ourselves engrossed in a complex role-playing title that pulls no punches. It\\'s a far cry from the franchise\\'s current form.”\\n\\n• It’s Time to Give Final Fantasy XII Another Chance [Tom\\'s Guide] “Final Fantasy XII first came out in 2006 as one of the last major titles on the PS2. The PS3 was less than a year away, and fans were wary after Final Fantasy XI turned out to be a massively multiplayer online game — a wild departure from the immersive single-player role-playing games that had defined the series up until that point. They also weren’t wild to learn that Final Fantasy XII borrowed a fair amount of MMO mechanics from its predecessors. Instead of tight, turn-based combat and cleverly designed dungeons, Final Fantasy XII focused on automated, real-time combat and enormous open stages with tons of secrets and not many artificial barriers. There was even a long string of monster-hunting side quests, adding to the “go there, kill that” feel of many online RPGs. What players may not remember, though, is that Final Fantasy XII was an open-world RPG before open-world RPGs were really a thing. No, the entire world wasn’t seamlessly connected, but the huge, explorable areas were a big departure from most other Japanese RPGs at the time.”\\n\\n• Final Fantasy 12\\'s Gambits remain the greatest mechanic in JRPGs [Eurogamer] “It is, perhaps most famously, the game that plays itself. Final Fantasy 12 was a peculiar entry in Square Enix\\'s banner RPG series in so many ways, but its most fascinating trait also proved to be its most divisive. It\\'s called the Gambit system, through which you can programme each of your characters, their responses and approaches to each encounter, until the combat is almost entirely automated. Push forward into a mob and let your scripting do the damage; sit back and admire your own ingenuity as it\\'s written across the screen in a flurry of metal and magic. Optimisation is a part of every RPG, but in Final Fantasy 12 it\\'s pushed to a brilliant new extreme - your party\\'s a machine that must be constantly tinkered with, tweaking one variable here and tightening up another there until you\\'ve got an engine that purrs. It is glorious.”',\n",

How do you define where an era of PC gaming begins and ends? Doing it by calendar year is arbitrary. Distinctions between operating systems are murky. Pre-internet? Pre-CD-ROM? Pre-accelerated graphics? Does the jump to VGA represent a new generation? After a lot of discussion, we felt that Intel's 486 processor represented one of the clearest PC gaming tree rings. Looking backward from the 486, you've got the golden age of the adventure genre, as well as the introduction of some of PC gaming's biggest franchises. After the 486, Intel's first Pentium processor kicked off an explosion of 3D games in 1996 (Quake, Tomb Raider), as well as the emergence of internet-connected games (Diablo, StarCraft, Ultima Online). So, our criterion for this 'build' is games that ran on a 486 or earlier architecture, as identified by the original system requirements.”\\n\",\n",

Led by Catholic hardliner B.A. Santamaria, the DLP would keep the ALP in opposition for almost two decades, giving the (right of centre, and then predominantly mainstream Protestant) Liberal Party a long spell in office. Now, lead by Santamaria's intellectual heirs, the same thing may be happening again—this time to the Liberal Party.The two heirs are the former Prime Minister and lapsed seminarian Tony Abbott, best known for undermining governments, biting into raw onions and other displays of machismo, who cited Santamaria as his inspiration for entering politics, and Cory Bernardi, a fellow ultraconservative, who recently left the Liberal Party to found a new party, the Australian Conservatives. Abbott is pushing the Liberal Party to change its candidate selection processes, allowing the rank and file (recently swollen with the membership of outer-suburban megachurches) more control, while Bernardi's Conservatives (recently merged with the Pentecostal/Dominionist party Family First) are threatening to take part of the Liberals' member base should this fail.\",\n",

Six are dead, three wounded, with one of the wounded in critical condition. The shootings were carried out in three different locations across the city before the suspect was apprehended near the city center.Kalamazoo is a town of less than 100,000 people located in southwest Michigan. It is a blue-collar city with a lot under the surface. It is more vibrant and artsy than one might initially expect of the locale. It has been featured in a surprising number of songs by Glenn Miller to Ben Folds. The Kalamazoo Art Museum has a modest but gorgeous collection (Chihuly!), the State Theater regularly attracts bigger and more diverse artists than you would think, and the Kalamazoo Civic Theater puts on a good show and has great opportunities for the youth who discovers there is finally a place where her exceptionally loud voice comes in handy. The city's central park is regularly a host to festivals like First Night, which attract local artists and performers from all around the area and manages to be a family-friendly event that is genuinely fun as hell and not lame. The Kalamazoo Public Library is extremely baller, or at least it was a decade ago.\\n\\nIt is the original home of Gibson Guitars and the location of Bell's Brewery. A proud ex-resident might, in a fit of pique, assert that the residents of this little Michigan city have been enjoying craft beer nearly 20 years before it started getting really popular.\\n\\nKalamazoo also contains an amazing Air Zoo, for all your classic, excellently painted plane needs. It is the start of the Kal-Haven Trail, which continues to extend through and past the city. The trail will take you all the way to the beach city of South Haven, where you can go jump into Lake Michigan (or just play in the sand if it's not June yet). Lake Michigan is the most superior of water bodies, being neither salty nor full of jellyfish. Since we're already enjoying the nature, you should also know about the Kalamazoo Nature Center, which will set you up for great disappointment if it is the first nature center you remember. No other nature centers will live up to the grand wooden bridge that leads across to the gorgeous, skylit Interpretive Center. You can go into a room full of butterflies, a huge mock tropical room, and look at blown up ants and caterpillars and learn all about Michigan wildlife. When you go outside you will find over 14 miles off well-maintained (but not *too* well-maintained!) trails, with lots of hidden spots by streams and ponds and overlooks. If you are very lucky, you will get to attend their summer camp and Dan Keto will be your counselor. He has won awards through nature interpreter's associations and has the ability to make a child care deeply about spiders or anything else within five minutes of meeting him.\\n\\nThe schools ain't too bad, either. Kalamazoo made headlines some years ago for The Kalamazoo Promise, which provides up to 100% of college tuition to any graduate of the Kalamazoo Public School system who goes to an in-state college or university. Not too shabby when the the University of Michigan is included in that. Oh, and if you are growing a little nerdling then send them to KAMSC. It will fill their heads with way more information than you expect a high schooler could fit in there, taught by incredible and quirky teachers who will nurture all the nerdy in-jokes your nerdling's heart could desire.\\n\\nKalamazoo will work it's way into your heart, and if you leave it for bigger, more cosmopolitan cities you will know it's not perfect--and yet wonder if it might be perfect enough to go back to.\\n\\nFor the next week Kalamazoo will join the growing list of many, many towns and cities across the USA, cited in Twitter debates, visited by candidates, offered platitudes. But during that week, and after that week, Kalamazoo will always be singularly special.\",\n",

He was 67. Mr. Mankell was considered the dean of the so-called Scandinavian noir writers who gained global prominence for novels that blended edge-of-your-seat suspense with flawed, compelling protagonists and strong social themes. The genre includes Arnaldur Indridason of Iceland, Jo Nesbo of Norway and Stieg Larsson of Sweden, among others.Mr. Mankell who led the way with 10 mystery novels featuring Inspector Kurt Wallander, a gruff but humane detective troubled by self-doubt, overeating, alcoholism and eventually dementia.

He wrote a trilogy about an African girl who lost both legs after stepping on a landmine, and her struggles as she grows up. He wrote one novel in which a Chinese man massacres an entire family in a remote Swedish village as revenge for the treatment meted out by their ancestors to his in the US in the 19th century. He took a strongly pro-Palestinian position, repeatedly comparing Israel to South Africa and asserting that it was building a new apartheid society, and he sailed on one of the ships that attempted to break the blockade of Gaza in 2010 and was seized by Israeli commandos. In later years he worried about the surveillance state, and warned that digital technologies were being used to make the individual transparent while governments and corporations could operate in secrecy.\\n\\n- 'How it feels to be diagnosed with cancer.' by Henning Mankell [The Guardian, 2014]\\n- Henning Mankell in quotes: 10 of the best.

Still, there are a few shows shaking up disability representation on television, with David M.

NPR recently added Game of Thrones to the list of notable shows regarding disabilities, though it\\'s not without issues.There\\'s criticism for characters adapting quite quickly to new limitations, and some concern for how certain characters may magically recover.

Initially, civil rights leaders called for peaceful protest, but community anger had reached a boiling point. In the  violence, destruction, and chaos that ensued, the police occupied the city, the National Guard was called in, and in the end 24 civilians  (including several women and children as young as 10), along with a firefighter and a police officer, were killed;  more than 500 were injured, and more than a thousand arrested. It was just one in the United States\\' long history of uprisings related to racism.A similar riot in Detroit, for similar reasons, followed within a week. Kenneth Stahl, who chronicled those events in his book The Great Rebellion, discussed the significance of the Newark riots as a precursor, noting in particular \"a crushing sense of nobodiness\" as a cause. \\n\\nIn New Jersey as elsehwere, people often accept the narrative that it was the violence of such uprisings in the 60s and 70s that destroyed cities\\' economies and caused their abandonment by white and moneyed people. Historian Tom Sugroe debunked that myth effectively in his book The Origins of the Urban Crisis, which focused on Detroit specifically but argued that white flight, lack of federal and bank investment, crumbling infrastructure, racism, and de-industrialization had all contributed to the decline of the cities long before they endured unrest - that, in fact, urban riots should be seen as a final, desperate reaction to the American abandonment of its cities, rather than a cause of it. \\n\\nMany people left the city, creating near-total economic devastation. But many stayed. In the past 10 years, development has increased, and a number of corporate headquarters and university programs have located here.  As residents remember the tragic events of 1976 fifty years later, many feel the city is entering an upswing, rising in recognition as an arts hub and cultural destination, though problems of racism, concentrated poverty, and lack of access to education and employment persist. On the other hand, gentrification\\'s threat to cohesive community life has become a new source of concern.

In it, the team took an old idea and changed its point of view, redesigning the idea of a 2D sidescroller and planting the camera behind its protagonist\\'s back for the majority of the game. To learn more about what happened along the way, we recently spoke to the entire development team, contractors, musicians, marketers and others, hearing a story of long nights, groundbreaking technology, unbearable crunches and expensive parties. However, not every story lines up the same way, with some feeling that Naughty Dog discredited their contributions by burying who actually created the flagship character. One thing rings true throughout: The tales culminate in the creation of a game that redefined the platformer genre and laid some of the early cornerstones for making Naughty Dog the juggernaut development studio it is today.”• Crash Bandicoot is gaming’s ultimate nostalgia act, and that’s okay [AV Club] “We so often get hung up on assigning importance to innovation and influence that we forget that cultural context is just as, if not more, relevant to a work’s legacy. From reading all the jubilant appraisals of the N. Sane Trilogy and talking to our own William Hughes, the closest thing to a Crash fan on our staff, one of the big reasons these games are so fondly remembered is that they filled a huge Mario/Sonic-shaped void in the lives of young PlayStation owners. The console’s early years were flooded with iconic games, but Crash was the first real kid-friendly mascot it ever had. His games were more goofy and vibrant than any of his polygonal contemporaries, and when you throw in the fact that they were difficult and secret-filled enough to require tons of replaying, you get a series that resonated with a lot of people at a very specific time and asked them to invest so much of themselves in it.”\\n\\n• The (re)making of \\'Crash Bandicoot\\' [Endgadget] “In trying to understand what Naughty Dog was going for, and how it achieved so much with so little back in 1996, the team found itself constantly referencing a wealth of original concept art, audio files, level geometry and the legacy games themselves. With two decades\\' worth of advancements at its disposal, a simple touch-up didn\\'t excite the team. \"We felt the standard remaster approach, of moving geometry over and raising the resolution of textures, would not be the right course for such an iconic character,\" said Dustin King, the game\\'s lead artist. \"We\\'re fans. We\\'ve spent a significant amount of time -- the previous six months before joining the Crash project -- working on the franchise, working on what makes Crash Crash,\" said lead level designer Leo Zuniga. \"When we joined [this] team, we had plenty of lessons learned but were still thinking, \\'How are we going to emulate [the originals] and do Naughty Dog justice?\\'\"”\\n\\n• Crash Bandicoot: The Game That Loves to Rub Your Face in Failure [Kotaku] “Punishing stages that stretch on and on, grinding down your enthusiasm with cheesy padding and crummy tricks. Terribly explained one-off mechanics that briefly surface, bemuse, infuriate, then slink back underground just as your blood is reaching boiling point. (I’m looking at you and your frustratingly random blackouts, Light Outs level). It’s not that Crash is always necessarily super difficult — the first set of stages on N. Sanity Island serve up a fairly gentle introduction to the pit-jumping, crate-smashing action. The problem is, even when you’re succeeding, there’s a sense the game forever wants to take you down a peg or two. Example? Every level ends with a completion screen that literally brings Crash to his knees unless you break 100% of the crates lying around a stage. Considering how taxing the core meat-and-potatoes platforming is, you’ll often miss a bunch of hard-to-reach crates in favour of pushing onto the next checkpoint. In most levels, I was lucky if I even smashed half of these apple-filled boxes — cue a 10 second stage-closing segment where Crash is pelted with every single crate he missed. Joy.”\\n\\n• Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy Review [Slant Magazine] “What, then, does Crash Bandicoot have to offer audiences in 2017, on a platform that currently plays host to no shortage of creative miracles as far as platformers go? Yes, the video-game compilation Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy does breathe new visual life into Crash Bandicoot, Cortex Strikes Back, and Warped. The slipshod, ancient polygons of these games have been given a top-to-bottom overhaul for the 21st century. Jungles are lush, vibrant places, and the textures and movements of every enemy live and breathe with realistic textures, while maintaining their trademark cartoonish animations. Water is crystal clear and inviting. But the gameplay throughout remains nothing short of bafflingly difficult. That fact is in sharp contrast with the actual mechanics of these games. The playing field is a limited-view corridor, with no way to get lost, and the controls are one small step above those of Super Mario Bros.: one button to jump, another to do a spin attack against enemies, and, starting with the second game, a third that let\\'s you slide and crawl.

Nevertheless, The University of East Anglia has started a campaign to encourage students to do so to save water.\\n\\nDo you use your phone in the toilet? The Buzzfeed survey indicates that this behavior is on the rise; there's a 9 percentage point increase in texting over this 2012 study. This may be why your cell phone has more germs than a toilet seat. Germs are primarily spread through improper handwashing; only 5% wash hands properly according to a study at Michigan State University. In case you don't know how, here are the CDC guidelines.\\n\\nShould you hover over the toilet or cover the seat? (Answer: sit the fuck down, princess.) \\n\\nAfraid to poop in public?

How do you use the toilets in India, or other places that use pit/squat toilets? Have a look at some other toilets around the world. The Numi by Kohler, at $6400,  is the most expensive toilet available to the consumer (previously), while Toto washlets are a mefi favorite.

       "              '156929': 'Hard Numbers Reveal Scale of America’s Trophy-Hunting Habit by Rachael Bale [National Geographic] Sport hunters, those who kill animals for recreation rather than out of necessity, imported more than 1.26 million trophies to the U.S. in the decade from 2005 through 2014, according to a new analysis of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s import data by Humane Society International and the Humane Society of United States. That’s an average of 126,000 trophy imports a year, or 345 a day.Related: \\n\\n- Activists condemn trophy-hunting club for \\'turning wildlife into commodities\\'. [The Guardian] The world’s largest trophy hunting club was on the defensive at its giant annual auction in Las Vegas as animal rights advocates and conservation experts traveled from across the globe to condemn the industry that killed Cecil, one of Africa’s most famous lions. The Safari Club International on Wednesday kicked off its elaborate four-day convention and “Ultimate Hunters’ Market” inside the Mandalay Bay luxury hotel and casino – drawing 25,000 people to the members-only show. In ballrooms and convention halls with signs describing the event as the “THE BIGGEST THE BEST”, hunters mingled with outfitters, gun makers, booking agents, taxidermists and other industry representatives and enthusiasts.\\n\\n- Can trophy hunting actually help conservation? by Jason G. Goldman [Conservation Magazine]One of the problems with hunting as a topic is that it’s a complex issue. People are by and large lazy, so little research is done outside of a narrow range of personal interests. There are so many types of hunting, such as subsistence hunting by communities on their own land; hunting on fenced private farms that choose wildlife over sheep; trophy hunting in unfenced areas near national parks; canned hunting and so on, and each has it’s own set of implications.  And there are the moral/ethical considerations to weigh with the conservation implications. In my view you shouldn’t lump all hunting debate into one pot and stir, you should rather try to understand each situation and then debate based on its merits. In that way you avoid generalising and insulting large groups of people (on both sides of the debate).\\n\\n- The Thing About Hunting: Why the hunting Conversation Hurts Conservation by Simon Espley [Africa Geographic] We humans tend to silo information to suit our personal requirements, and make enemies out of those who feel differently. We might agree on 99% of things, but the 1% apparently makes us enemies. Lets face it, we either hate Kendall Jones or we adore her – there is no middle ground. So the chatter around her tends to be angry, emotional, defensive and meaningless in the greater scheme of things – which is of course what she wants: the more attention she can generate the higher she ranks in the race for social media fame. And while we bolster her fame, the process of turning Africa’s incredible biodiversity into trophies, trinkets, medicine and lifestyle products continues apace. The enemies of conservation are well-resourced, focussed and not distracted by the chatter about who has the moral high ground.\\n\\n- In defense of Texas huntress and conservationist Kendall Jones by Charlotte Allen [Los Angeles Times] After Jones gave an interview to TMZ titled “Why Does Facebook Want Me Dead?,” a commenter wrote: “People don’t want kendall dead — just to use her as target practice, feel a lot of pain, bleed some, get stitches — repeat. It’s that simple.” And then there was this, as reported by CBC: “A [100,000-signature] petition circulated on the White House’s Change.org website demands that Jones be banned from Africa. Anonymous commenters said Jones should be hunted down like the animals she targeted. Rape threats followed. Some called her a ‘slut’ and ‘bimbo.’ Misdirected rage assailed other blond women who shared the name Kendall Jones.” Yet, when Katniss Everdeen of “The Hunger Games” wields her bow and arrow, she’s hailed by feminists as “feisty” and “independent.” When Kendall Jones wields hers, she’s denounced as a shameless self-promoter who wears short shorts and makeup (horrors!) and posts mean memes about vegetarians.\\n\\n- In Defence of the Trophy Hunt by Michael Petrou [Maclean\\'s Magazine] Cecil, like all lions, was magnificent to behold. But let us acknowledge that is a subjective appraisal. He was less intelligent than the pigs we raise in cramped factory farms and kill in industrial slaughterhouses. He was a rare animal, but not an endangered one. There are more than 30,000 lions in Africa. He had a black mane and was said to be friendly—a clear case of anthropomorphism, which likely means he had simply grown used to safari jeeps. So why the outrage over his death? Much has to do with how we perceive lions. They are evocative and iconic, which is why they have adorned heraldry for millennia. Much also has to do with why he was killed: for the perceived sport in it, and for the “trophy” pelt and head.\\n\\n- In Zimbabwe, We Don’t Cry for Lions by Goodwell Nzou [The New York Times] MY mind was absorbed by the biochemistry of gene editing when the text messages and Facebook posts distracted me. So sorry about Cecil. Did Cecil live near your place in Zimbabwe? Cecil who? I wondered. When I turned on the news and discovered that the messages were about a lion killed by an American dentist, the village boy inside me instinctively cheered: One lion fewer to menace families like mine. My excitement was doused when I realized that the lion killer was being painted as the villain. I faced the starkest cultural contradiction I’d experienced during my five years studying in the United States. Did all those Americans signing petitions understand that lions actually kill people? That all the talk about Cecil being “beloved” or a “local favorite” was media hype? Did Jimmy Kimmel choke up because Cecil was murdered or because he confused him with Simba from “The Lion King”? In my village in Zimbabwe, surrounded by wildlife conservation areas, no lion has ever been beloved, or granted an affectionate nickname. They are objects of terror.\\n\\n- A Hunting Ban Saps a Village’s Livelihood by Normitsu Onishi [The New York Times] Lions have been coming out of the surrounding bush, prowling around homes and a small health clinic, to snatch goats and donkeys from the heart of this village on the edge of one of Africa’s great inland deltas. Elephants, too, are becoming frequent, unwelcome visitors, gobbling up the beans, maize and watermelons that took farmers months to grow. Since Botswana banned trophy hunting two years ago, remote communities like Sankuyo have been at the mercy of growing numbers of wild animals that are hurting livelihoods and driving terrified villagers into their homes at dusk. The hunting ban has also meant a precipitous drop in income. Over the years, villagers had used money from trophy hunters, mostly Americans, to install toilets and water pipes, build houses for the poorest, and give scholarships to the young and pensions to the old.\\n\\n- Jane Goodall Asks Tough Question About Cecil The Lion [The Dodo] After expressing her initial mourning, Goodall asks questions that put Cecil\\'s death in the context of trophy hunting as a whole. How can anyone with an ounce of compassion be proud of killing these magnificent creatures? Lions, leopards, sable antelopes, giraffes and all the other sport or trophy animals are beautiful – but only in life. In death they represent the sad victims of a sadistic desire to attract praise from their friends at the expense of innocent creatures. And when they claim they respect their victims and experience emotions of happiness at the time of the killing, then surely this must be the joy of a diseased mind? There are many ethical issues, which we seldom face up to, whenever an animal is killed. For example, is it \"worse\" to shoot a wild boar for food than to slaughter an imprisoned factory farmed hog? Does the life of a wild turkey matter more than the life of a free range domestic turkey? Is the person who grants a license to the hunter, or the one who authorizes that person, or the one who drafts the laws that make it legal to do this, as guilty as the person who pulls the trigger (or fires the crossbow)? These and many other such questions are seldom asked. And when they are, they sometimes seem impossible to answer. But trophy hunting is hard to defend. And the outpouring of anger and hatred occasioned by the killing of Cecil shows how many people feel that the days of the great White Hunter should be brought to a close. It is excellent news that many airlines have now refused to carry trophies. Cecil has become, albeit unknowingly, a martyr for a cause.

Last week saw the relative up-and-comer Alex Crossan, aka Mura Masa, blend vintage jungle sounds with a range of modern styles (BBC, MixesDB, Global DJ Mix), from Thom Yorke to MF Doom. The week prior, Dominick Martin, aka Calibre, spun two hours in the studio, oscillating between drum\\'n\\'bass and more ambient soundscapes (BBC, MixesDB, Global DJ Mix), weaving in a bit of Charles Bukowski to set the mood. Where Mura Masa presented in advance of his new self-titled album (streaming via Spotify embedded), Calibre has a dozen albums to date, with his newest, The Deep (official track samples on YouTube), released this past March. More music and musing below the break.Mura Masa\\'s new record is \"brimming with nowness,\" with \"dancehall-lite tones of [the] slightly problematic ... tropical house,\" though \"Mura Masa manages to miraculously transcend its generic core\" (Guardian), and his production is paired with A$AP Rocky, Charli XCX, Jamie Lidell, A.K. Paul and Damon Albarn. Contrary to most reviews calling that album his debut, this is actually his second. His first, Soundtrack to a Death (Bandcamp), was released in 2014 on the JAKARTA label. \"Soundtrack\" has a lot of the same mellow \"tropical\" dance/house vibes  as his new album, but without the bevy of guest artists found on his new album. And some of his new album features older tracks, like the  A$AP Rocky-featuring remix (official video) of the stunning Lovesick (Fuck) (official audio), which came out in 2015 on the Someday Somewhere EP (Bandcamp). As seen on Discogs Crossan also has a few more singles out as Mura Masa, plus official videos on YouTube. \\n\\nCalibre, on the other hand, is an older name on the drum\\'n\\'bass scene, with 12 albums (and a ton of singles and EPs) to his name. The Signature Recordings founder has championed a unique brand of future Funk and syncopated Soul that has left an indelible imprint on the Drum & Bass landscape forever (The Sound Advice). But with his prior album, Grow  (sample of tracks on Soundcloud), Martin ditched his usual drum & bass fare, but it\\'s still full of high tempos, low-end menace and bluesy atmospheres, touching on deep house and dubstep, if you\\'re looking to pin down a genre or two. Flip back to the prior record, Spill (\"full album mix\" by a fan, on YouTube), very much so Calibre and a bit more feel-good in comparison to previous albums (DNB Dose).

       "              '167691': 'Why The Elder Scrolls Online Is Worth Playing In 2017 [MMOS World] “Today, The Elder Scrolls Online is almost a different game. Majority of the complaints from launch have been addressed. Fan favorite Elder Scrolls guilds like the Thieves Guild and The Dark Brotherhood have been added. The game is now on consoles, reaching a wider audience for revenue benefits. Level gated mechanics have been removed with the One Tamriel update, and gone are the days of player limitations. Level scaling arrived as well. On top of all that in the past year and a half, regular developer updates have hinted at things to come and they are worth the wait too.  So why should players get excited for 2017? The answer is because the developers aren’t stopping with the good news.”• The jaws of Oblivion: Saving the Elder Scrolls MMO [Polygon] “How do you take one of the biggest franchises in games and move it to an entirely different genre without losing what makes it special? That was the question posed by the team at ZeniMax Media when it formed ZeniMax Online Studios in 2007. Its answer was The Elder Scrolls Online, an ambitious project to take the world of Tamriel — made famous by single-player games like The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion — and reshape it into a massively-multiplayer online game. But in 2011, four years after work began, studio director Matt Firor and his team started to think they might be on the wrong track. The feedback from internal playtests was mixed. ESO was just OK, and OK wasn’t anywhere close to good enough. [...] \"I would say that Destiny is just as much an MMO as any other game that has ever been made. But it\\'s not what you would think of as a traditional MMO. And we were in that category when we started ESO. We were making a traditional MMO. But we ended up making something very different. \"At it\\'s heart, ESO really is a role-playing game. It just has all these other players in it. But if you call it an MMO, then a lot of the baggage comes in from 2004 which may or may not apply any more.”\\n\\n• ESO: Morrowind Review in Progress – My Return from a 3-Year Hiatus [Game Revolution] “ESO: Morrowind hasn\\'t forsaken its roots. I\\'ve found myself constantly stumbling upon quest opportunities, most of which are deeply interesting. This proves to be the greatest strength of the expansion, as it delivers dozens of hours of new narrative experiences that take influence from one of the greatest Elder Scrolls games in history. [...] If you\\'re like me and didn\\'t enjoy the original ESO experience, then you may want to give this a look, if only to give yourself an excuse to experience the major improvements that the One Tamriel update ushered last year. Among its long list of features was a level scaling system, which effectively allows you to engage in just about any content you desire as its enemies will scale to your level. This makes it very easy to group up with friends and explore where you\\'d like without fear that you\\'ll get one-shot. There were some other notable features included that transformed the game in significant ways, earning praise from fans and some haters alike.”\\n\\n• The Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind [IGN] “Stepping off the boat in Seyda Neen at the beginning of The Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind brought back a flood of memories from 2002’s The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Seeing the plain wooden dock extend out in front of me toward the small hamlet made me feel as though I were 15 years younger, ready to tackle the world laid out in front of me. In every pixel, The Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind strives to create this feeling. And the centerpiece island of Vvardenfell, coupled with a new interesting class and stellar writing, make this a great new expansion. If there is a downside, it’s the fact that Vvardenfell is so faithfully recreated here that it diminishes the sense of discovery and wonder for series veterans. I pretty much knew where everything is located, and that costs it some of the luster that ESO brought when it first launched. That said, while you can find familiar locations, the ESO: Morrowind takes place 700 years before the events of the single-player game, and that allows for some differences that make it worthy of exploration.”\\n\\n• Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind, Nostalgia makes a decent expansion something special. [PC World] “As I wander through the island of Vvardenfell I find myself stumbling on old memories. Here’s the mountain near Suran where I fought Umbra, the depressed orc who wished to die a warrior’s death but was too strong to be defeated by normal adventurers. There’s the mountain pass where I was dive-bombed by dozens of cliff racers. Here’s the Dwemer stronghold I tried to jump over for a half-hour before realizing it’d be easier to go around. There are ancestral tombs, the Morag Tong, the Fighter\\'s Guild, the Mage\\'s Guild. The mushrooms! The long-legged Silt Striders! Walking into the city of Balmora there’s the building where a Khajiit fence bought all my illicit moon sugar. Ald’ruhn is a smaller settlement in the expansion, which takes place 700 years before the events of The Elder Scrolls III proper, but still has its trademark giant crab shell in the center. And always, the Red Mountain, Dagoth Ur, dominates the horizon with its magma-heat glow. It\\'s an ever-present ill omen, although I haven\\'t found a reason to scale its charred expanse yet.”\\n\\n• Bethesda E3 2017: Exec Explains Why Elder Scrolls 6 Not Happening Soon Is A Good Move [GameSpot] “Hines told GameSpot today that Howard\\'s team wanted to \"work on some other stuff and do some other things\" after releasing Fallout 4, which has surpassed Skyrim to become Bethesda\\'s most successful game ever. He added that Bethesda Game Studios did not want to be known as a developer that only made Elder Scrolls and Fallout games. \"Quite honestly, they didn\\'t want to be the developer that was just Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Fallout for the rest of their development careers,\" Hines said. \"And you\\'ve got a lot of people in that studio who have been there for a really long time. They wanted to be able to self-determine things they worked on next, whether it was existing stuff whether it was new IP. \"And I think Todd and his team have earned the right, given the quality of this stuff, to be able to say, \\'We know everybody really wants Elder Scrolls VI, but we as creative people want to be able to do stuff tat we\\'re really passionate about.\\' And I think once you see how the next two titles come out and then how Elder Scrolls 6 ties into what those games are doing and about, I think it\\'ll all make sense.

The hair looked right. It looked good, even, and it wasn’t played for a joke. Characters with afros, like this unnamed woman in the trailer for A Way Out, weren’t shucking and jiving. Her hair texture implies that “particulate mass of hyper-tight curls” that Narcisse describes. [...] There are a lot of cool looking games featuring—or even starring—black women that were shown at E3 this year. From Wolfenstein II’s hard-edged revolutionary to Far Cry 5\\'s Grace Armstrong to the Dishonored DLC’s Billie Lurk, this was the first E3 in recent memory where I couldn’t just count all the women of all color on one hand. It’s frankly amazing, and I’m really excited to play these games. Especially Wolfenstein II. I love everything about this unnamed character who is part of the American resistance against the Nazis, and I want to meet this socialist revolutionary cell, thanks.”• The Natural: The Trouble Portraying Blackness in Video Games [Kotaku] “Usually, I have to settle. Resign myself to picking the black color option out of a customization palette wheel and selecting a cut that hews relatively close to the scalp. The caesar cuts of myriad video games—like George Clooney used to wear in his early days on E.R.— have become a glum safe haven for my natural aspirations. “Ok, fine,” I tell myself, “I guess I can choke this down. I always wanted to look like a Klingon from the original Star Trek episodes.” (No, not really. I haven’t wanted that look. No one ever has.) A black friend told me, “I’ve done this exact thing so many times. It’s especially a moment in online games, when I’m on a Skype call with my friends waiting for me to join them. I just sorta break down and go, ugh, fine, the caesar is close enough.” Even when I lie to myself and say that the color and density are close to acceptable, I can still see the stringy, thread-like locks fringing around the hairline. Nope. Not black hair. At least, it’s not my black hair.” \\n• Black Skin Is Still A Radical Concept in Video Games [Waypoint] “What unites the developers mentioned in this article is the time and effort they have committed to ensuring that the characters in their games are not treated as afterthoughts; as NPC number 28, as that default and thoughtless shade of brown or black that game technology thus far has put forward as the status quo. There may not be a space yet for rich, vividly detailed black skin in games, but the efforts of Allen, Moore, Small, and their many contemporaries in the industry, set a strong example for others to follow. With ever-improving technology, it\\'s seductive to believe that lighting darker characters will naturally improve alongside light ones. But even in the world of film, where technology has largely plateaued, inconsistencies remain. Real change also requires intention. Films like Moonlight reveal the impressive amount of ground that can be covered when the people leading the project have a plan for lighting their black actors from the jump.”\\n\\n• The Profound Quandary of Blackness in the Video Game ‘Detroit: Become Human’ [The Root] “Why do black people get annoyed when someone says he or she “doesn’t see color”? It’s because inherent in that claim is the idea that someone has deemed that black people subscribe sufficiently to his or her cultural standards to be seen as nondescript—equal. In “Detroit: Become Human,” the protagonist is not tasked with proving that a group seen as subhuman is really just as human as its oppressors. Androids aren’t human. They are different—unrelatable, to some extent, to those not born one. Pinch yourself if this is sounding familiar. A “woke” black protagonist is tasked with proving that life wholly other, inherently unrelatable and as profoundly inhuman as the white nationalists in my Twitter feed perceive black people to be is separate but every bit as equal in its value—regardless of how inhuman anyone perceives it to be.”\\n\\n• Black character creator options in video games still have a long way to go [Mic] “Both FIFA and Mass Effect are published by Electronic Arts, one of the biggest gaming studios around. But there\\'s another game in EA\\'s lineup that relies even more heavily on designing your avatar. The Sims is the company\\'s crown jewel of character customization, but EA told me that it\\'s fully aware it needs to produce more authentic-looking people. \"Fans point out African-American hair is a weakness for us,\" Lyndsay Pearson, executive producer of The Sims, said in a phone call. \"We don\\'t have many options that I like yet, honestly.\"  Pearson added the game\\'s graphics pose a challenge when it comes to deciding which hairstyles make it into the game. \"We\\'ve gotten better at [hair] like dreadlocks and cornrows,\" she said. \"Those are simpler because of geometry, but they\\'re not the whole spectrum.\" The next challenge is making these styles actually look natural. \"We don\\'t want it to feel like a paper doll,\" she said. \"Like you took the nose off of one character and stuck it on another. It\\'s very important that our technology behind the scenes is meshing all of those pieces together in a way that actually represents real facial anatomy.\"”\\n\\n• What Happened to All the Black Games? [Medium] “These days, commercial Black games are dead. As video games came into their own as a medium, they copied the stylings -and demographics- of Hollywood movies. The bald, white male protagonist was introduced, a presumed default for all of games: white boys. As games “matured”, they also adopted the post 9/11 mindset of foreign brown people as the enemy, and with the election of Obama (and his presumed Muslim ties), both foreign and domestic brown people became enemies. Even the games or studios that explored browness before this period changed course, or were ultimately shuttered, whether to do with how the recession affected minorities or a resurgence in islamophobia and anti blackness in America. Assassin’s Creed ran from it’s muslim protagonist, moving to a white Italian. EA Big was shuttered in 2008. Grand Theft Auto went back to a white protagonist, following San Andreas and Vice City Stories’ black ones. From 2007–2012, not a single game had a unique black protagonist in a game that wasn’t licensed or a joke. ”\\n\\n• Gaming while black: Casual racism to cautious optimism [Endgadget] “The stories Allen could tell probably wouldn\\'t surprise Dr. Kishonna Gray.

She studies gaming and harassment from the player\\'s point of view. \"Most gamers of color have isolated themselves into private parties, private chats, or just don\\'t engage verbally at all,\" Dr. Gray said. \"And that\\'s sad because they can\\'t take full advantage of the gaming experience that they paid for. So what\\'s happening is a virtual ghettoization of minority gamers. [...] Because a person\\'s identity is automatically revealed when a person speaks, they are targeted.

But throughout much of its history, that title could just as easily have fallen to the Post Office, which was a hotbed of new, interesting, sometimes crazy ideas as it sought to accomplish a seemingly simple task: deliver mail quickly and cheaply. The Post Office experimented with everything from stagecoaches to airplanes—even pondered sending mail cross-country on a missile. For decades, the agency integrated new technologies and adapted to changing environments, underpinning its ability to deliver billions of pieces of mail every year, from the beaches of Miami to the banks of Alaska, for just cents per letter.We think a lot about how innovation arises, but not enough about how it gets quashed. And the USPS is a great example of both. Today, what was once a locus of innovation has become a tired example of bureaucratic inertia and government mismanagement. The agency always faced an uphill battle, with frequent political interference from Congress, and the ubiquity of the internet has changed how Americans communicate in unforeseeable ways. But its descent into its current state was not foretold. A series of misguided rules and laws have clipped the Post Office’s wings, turning one of the great inventors of the government into yet another clunky bureaucracy. As a new administration once again takes up the cause of “reinventing government,” it’s worth considering what made the Post Office one of the most inventive parts of the nation’s infrastructure—and what factors have dragged it down.',\n",

       "              '168345': 'Server Crashes, 40GB Patches and DLC: Gaming\\'s Biggest Irritations Explained [The Guardian] “Video games have changed immeasurably since the days of tape loading and cover-mounted floppy discs. Today, we get lifelike 3D virtual worlds where the player can seamlessly connect with companions and opponents from every corner of the globe. An online triple-A title will now offer literally hundreds of hours of fun spread across years of play. Yet, inflation aside, the price we pay at the till remains the same now as it was 25 years ago. To make this possible, a lot of things have changed about the way the games industry works – but those changes haven’t always been well received. When problems arise, frustrated consumers will often blame “money-grubbing” publishers or “lazy” developers. But is that fair? We asked the industry to explain five of the most controversial aspects of modern games buying – and, crucially, why they happen. 1. Downloadable content 2. Season passes 3. Day-one patches 4. Pre-orders 5. Server crashes”• With the Apparent Death of Season Passes and $15 DLC, Did We Actually End Up With a Worse Deal? [VG24/7] “For the longest time, games followed a single cadence with post-launch content: expansion packs that launched at around 50 percent of the base game’s price, and required the main game to function. Then DLC happened, and with it came season passes. Since then, season passes and piece-meal content packs have been the defacto way for publishers to support multiplayer games post launch, until very recently. Suddenly, one game after another started offering or promising post-launch content for free. Sometimes this takes the form of new maps, modes, and weapons. The one thing all games that shifted to this model have in common is microtransactions. For the most part, these tend to offer cosmetic items and other trinkets that don’t interfere with gameplay. When they do interfere, they’re handled well enough that you can ignore them, or earn an equivalent just by playing. This move has largely been positively received, save for those who have a principled stance against microtransactions in full-priced games.”\\n\\n• Season Passes Are Starting To Sound Like Scams [Game Informer] “The first season pass that I can remember clearly was for Rockstar Games’ L.A. Noire. Although many people (myself included) reacted negatively at the notion of pre-buying DLC, Rockstar successfully detailed its plans for L.A. Noire’s extended content with descriptions and release dates for each piece. Yes, Rockstar put an incentive on buying it quickly – a two-dollar deduction for early birds – but there was no guesswork on the consumer’s part. We knew exactly what we were getting into. That’s an example of how season passes can (and should) work. Given how these passes are issued now (especially the examples I listed), they sound like scams coming from money-hungry corporations. The point of DLC is to entice the player base to hold onto their game and revisit it. I get that. I like the proposition of getting more value out of my game, even if I have to pay for it in some way. But I want to feel confident in my purchases, and not be left wondering if I’m being taken advantage of.”\\n\\n• The Multiplayer Season Pass is Almost Dead, This is How For Honor and Titanfall 2 Are Killing It [GamesRadar+] “For Honor\\'s developers plan to release all of the game\\'s post-release multiplayer maps and modes for free, following more than a year of high-profile games that have abandoned the once-common paid DLC format. If you play many big, non-free-to-play multiplayer games, this development likely feels long overdue for you, and doubly so for your wallet. Titanfall 2, Rainbow Six Siege, Overwatch, and Gears of War 4 have all taken a similar angle. The latest scions of the two big shooter series, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Battlefield 1, persist in parceling out paid map packs on top of their full game price, but clearly the times are a-changin\\' - I wouldn\\'t be surprised if this is the last year for both of their usual passes as we know them. It\\'s a welcome sea change for multiplayer gaming, and the reason couldn\\'t be simpler. [...] “We need to trust the player and they need to trust us,” McCoy said. “Trust that if we do the right thing - not sell maps and modes - we’ll get more people investing with us, investing in the game as a whole. They’re going to trust us not to screw them over and they can be happy with their $60 versions”. That doesn\\'t mean multiplayer games just want to take your $60 and to leave it at that, of course. They\\'re just finding smarter, less-disruptive ways to get extra cash out of you.”\\n\\n• 7 Reasons Why Gamers Support DLC and Season Passes [The Gizmo Life] 1. Season Passes are cheaper\\n2.

DLC items sometimes give godly benefits\\n7. To show support to the developers\\n\\n• From Expansion Packs to DLC: The Evolution of Additional Video Game Content [The Artifice] “Anyone with a good internet connection now has the ability to purchase and download a title on release day. Good expansion packs like those for the older Blizzard games on PC are not things of the past as some would think – The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine being an example of that – yet the marketplace is filled with an over abundance of frivolous offers that many see as a detriment to the entire industry of video gaming, a shallow cash grab from a cynic’s point of view. Overall, what the history of additional content for video games has shown is that it is not the distribution abilities that is the pivotal aspect to what makes additional content worth it or not, but whether or not the time and care was put into the project. Because of the high profits being made currently, this practice that the majority of game companies follow concerning downloadable content will continue on without any major changes. Gamers should demand that additional content be something that thoroughly expands on the initial experience of the original title, and perhaps most importantly these additions must show that the makers respect their fanbase.”\\n\\n• Nintendo’s New Fire Emblem DLC Costs More Than the Game Itself [The Verge] “Given that Shadows of Valentia costs $39.99, that makes either DLC option more expensive than the base game, something that even games with price $50 season passes like Star Wars: Battlefront, Call of Duty, and Battlefield 1 have yet to accomplish. That price gets you five DLC packs: Fledgling Warriors, which offers two new maps and a dungeon to explore; Undaunted Heroes, for another two maps and a dungeon; Lost Altars, which will add some more dungeons and new character classes, Rise of the Deliverance, which offers some prologue story DLC with new missions and voice acting; and a fifth and final pack that Nintendo has yet to detail. While that’s not a bad selection of content when it comes to add-ons to the base game, the total price — which is, again, more than the entire “main” game — isn’t a great look for Nintendo, which had spent years holding out on selling downloadable content and instead simply packaged games as complete experiences out of the box.”\\n\\n• What\\'s One Lesson You Wish Developers and Publishers Would Learn? [Destructoid] GoofierBrute: File both of these under the \"never going to happen\" folder, but I wish publishers would A) stop rushing out their games just to meet a deadline, and B) don\\'t announce DLC or a Season Pass when the game isn\\'t out yet. Let me break it down: \\nA) In the case of the first one, I wish publishers and developers would take their time when it came developing games. I know this is all about money, and in this day and age of digital distribution it\\'s super easy to patch games, but you only get one chance and make a good first impression. Take No Man\\'s Sky; it\\'s a lot better now than it was when it first came out, but because the game was such a disappointing mess, it doesn\\'t matter that it\\'s better because everyone else just moved on. I\\'m not saying a game should be indefinite development (hello Duke Nukem Forever), but a game shouldn\\'t be rushed out the door just to meet a deadline.

The dungeon-crawler’s gore and corruption are assets of the 20-year-old franchise that, when you’re grinding for levels on end, can fade into the background. After a few hours on Diablo 3, I’ve gone into unthinking destruction mode, killing monster upon monster as if I were a kid stomping on anthills. Diablo 3’s Necromancer lets you embody and manipulate D3’s darkness, and by becoming a part of D3’s morbid world, I felt more connected to it.”• Deadly Roots: The Lore of the Necromancer [Blizzard] “Where do Necromancers come from? What is the Balance, and why do they care so much about it? And when exactly did these mysterious figures first begin practicing their dark arts? Whether you’ve played a Necromancer in Diablo II or are simply looking forward to playing one in Diablo III, you might have pondered the answers to the above! [...] A star has fallen on Tristram Cathedral [You Tube] [Opening Cinematic], and the Necromancers will answer the call. You have been asked by your Master to bring rest to the dead and restore the Balance. What untold powers will you discover to aid you? What challenges will you face, and how will you overcome them? What new insights will you gain when you revisit parts of the campaign, especially when it comes to matters of life and death? Your journey begins, Necromancer. . . To all who oppose you: beware!\\n\\n• Diablo 3's Necromancer brings back the most satisfying ability in the series. [PC Gamer] “To give you an idea of how the Necromancer operates, here are five things he might do to you should you run into him in a dungeon:\\n1. The Necromancer sucks out all of your blood. He blows up your corpse to kill your friends nearby.\\n2. A twelve-foot tall flesh golem belly-flops onto you and collapses into a pile of corpse bits, which the Necromancer then blows up to kill you.\\n3. The Necromancer impales your friend with a bone spike. A homing spike of ribs then explodes out of your friend's body and kills you.\\n4. The Necromancer points at you and seven skeletons with broadswords run over and kill you.\\n5. The Necromancer just hangs around nearby and all your flesh falls off. This kills you.”\\n\\n• Diablo 3's Necromancer is great, but it can't raise Diablo 2 from the dead. [Eurogamer] “Based on the beta, much more committed players than me have declared themselves broadly satisfied by the Necromancer; it currently has two viable endgame builds, apparently, which is could be better but is just about good enough, and certainly offers plenty for the community to get their teeth into. Charging £13 for just the class and little else might seem steep from an outside perspective, but in Diablo 3 the classes are the only content that really matters. Besides, Blizzard are the unmatched virtuosos of character class design, unfailingly offering interesting, layered and high-impact twists on familiar archetypes across all their games. The Necromancer is no different; just another masterclass in a game that can boast several, from a studio that has dozens more to its name. There's one thing it can't do, though, and that's bring Diablo 2 back from the dead. But perhaps it's more just that, at this late stage in the game's life, it should instead remind us of everything that is great about Diablo 3.”\",\n",

Learn about the classic SRPG [Games Radar+] “Mario, Zelda, and Metroid star in some of the most beloved franchises in all of gaming, but some of Nintendos oldest properties have never really caught on in the west (and thats even if Nintendo bothered to localize them). Fire Emblem is one such series, and the most recent entry, Fire Emblem: Awakening, is just hitting US stores. Yet, as exciting as that new release might be for franchise fans, Fire Emblem leaves the majority of gamers confused by each new tactical entry. Now that interest in the series is as higher than it has been in some time, we created this feature in the hopes of clearing some things up about its substantial history and seemingly arcane rules. Whether youre totally new to the series or in need of a refresher before Awakening hits the 3DS, this should at least give you some idea of why Fire Emblem has been around for more than 20 years”\\n\\n• Pocket Primer: A complete history of Fire Emblem [Pocket Gamer] “We thought we\\'d take a quick trip down memory lane to look back at the complete history of this venerable strategy series. While it wasn\\'t the first tactical RPG, Fire Emblem was still one of the earliest games in which grid-based tactical battles were mashed up with RPG-style character progression. It also featured permadeath, so defeated units would be lost forever. Most of the Fire Emblem games were exclusive to Japan, and it took almost 15 years for the first English Fire Emblem game to materialise. So, don\\'t be too embarrassed if you don\\'t recognise half the games below.”\\n\\n• The past, present and future of Fire Emblem [Eurogamer] “We discussed what would be possible to make in the short time until the development of the new game for Nintendo Switch really starts, and we decided it would be best to work on a remake instead of a brand new title.\" It\\'s a swan song of sorts for Fire Emblem on the 3DS (although it\\'s worth remembering that Fire Emblem Warriors, the musou spin-off, will also be releasing on the handheld later this year), and a chance to say farewell to the hardware that helped revive the series. As famously noted in an Iwata Asks interview between the late president of Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, Fire Emblem was considered a series on its way out before Awakenings revived its fortunes. After Echoes, though, there\\'s set to be a retooling of the series when it lands on Switch next year. \"I\\'m very happy that we were able to announce a new game for the home console, Nintendo Switch,\" says Intelligent Systems\\' Masahiro Higuchi. \"I\\'m confident that the gameplay of Fire Emblem hasn\\'t lost anything by being on handhelds such as Game Boy Advance,  Nintendo DS or Nintendo 3DS. By returning to a home console though, we can deliver a title with a level of quality higher than on a handheld not only in terms of game system, but also in terms of graphics and audio too.\"”\\n\\n• Fire Emblem reaches into the past to give the series a fresh new feel with Shadows of Valentia [Retronauts] “I very nearly embarrassed myself with my take on Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia. If I hadn\\'t realized a few days ago that the latest 3DS entry in Nintendo and Intelligent Systems\\' strategy RPG franchise is a remake of an old Famicom game, I might have waxed rhapsodic about how it offers a \"welcome burst of inspiration\" or \"finally helps add some interesting new innovation\" to the series\\' formula. As it turns out, though, the \"innovation\" that makes Valentia so appealing was in fact laid down 25 years ago in the original version of the game: Fire Emblem Gaiden. If you remember Shadow Dragon, that remake simply brought the original Fire Emblem for Famicom up to approximately Game Boy Advance standards. It boasted nicer, more detailed visuals and more elaborate text than the older version, but otherwise, it felt pretty similar to the 8-bit release. Valentia, on the other hand, brings an older to the standards of the original 3DS Fire Emblem titles — and then takes it a step further. The combat engine comes straight from Fates: You shuffle your little strategy pawns as 2D sprites around a slightly tilted battlefield, and once a combat encounter commences the camera zooms in and blurs to a cinematic 3D sequence in which your characters\\' actions play out against a foe. This time, however, the 3D view serves an expanded role. It\\'s not just about looking pretty; once you claim certain map areas from the foe, you\\'re allowed to venture into that building or dungeon. ”\\n\\n• Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia Takes a Calculated Risk By Revamping the Strategy RPG [IGN] “For those who were lucky enough to find a way to play Fire Emblem Gaiden, it soon became apparent what set it apart as the black sheep of the Fire Emblem family. Many new and odd mechanics were added to Gaiden that would either never be seen again, or slowly return as the series finally expanded for release overseas. Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia faithfully brings many of these interesting mechanics back - but also tweaks them with new features that seems to avoid some of the pitfalls that Gaiden faced back on the Famicom. [...] Battles may look familiar enough at first glance, but there’s a lot to take in quickly if you want all your units to survive. For starters, the familiar weapon triangle is gone. No more swords beating axes, or spears beating swords - nor is there a hierarchy for magic. And speaking of magic, your casters are even more like glass cannons this time around. Spellcasting, while powerful, drains various amounts of health per cast, forcing you to guard them closely or rely on lifestealing magic like Nosferatu to gain back lost health.”\\n\\n• Fire Emblem Heroes review: deftly striking a balance between free and fun. [The Verge] “Fire Emblem Heroes is trying to be two very different things at the same time. On one side, it’s a major new release from Nintendo, in this case the latest entry in a long-running and greatly respected turn-based strategy series from renowned studio Intelligent Systems. With a dedicated fanbase, it has a lot to live up to. On the other side, it’s a free-to-play mobile title, a game designed in part to get players to fork out cash to play longer or unlock new characters. These two disparate halves should seemingly lead to a game that feels at odds with itself. But for the most part, Heroes deftly balances the two, resulting in a streamlined strategy game that mostly resembles Fire Emblem, but in a way that feels at home on your phone. [...] The biggest difference between combat in Heroes and other Fire Emblem games is the sense of scale. Skirmishes are much smaller here with each map is designed to fit entirely on your phone’s screen. Your team of soldiers is limited to four, comparatively small to the dozen-strong armies of its predecessors.”\\n\\n• Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright and Conquest [Kotaku] “Fates is a tactical role-playing game that allows players to control an army of fantasy chess pieces. Each piece has its own rules for movement and combat, and more importantly, each piece is its own individual character with his or her own specific hopes and dreams. The more you fight alongside your troops, the better you’ll get to know them outside of the battlefield. Fire Emblem is as much about relationships as it is about war. While the long-running Fire Emblem series has let players foster relationships with troops for a while now, Awakening intensified things by letting characters have kids with each other. It was a decision that split the fanbase between those who loved the military maneuvering but feared the series was turning into “anime garbage,” and those who were delighted to have an unusual brand of dating sim to play. The game’s makers at Intelligent Systems must have noticed that divide, because the latest Fire Emblem is split into two versions: Birthright and Conquest. Each game has unique aspirations that cater to the tastes of the two camps, and depending on which one you choose to play, you’ll get an entirely different set of characters to meet, war scenarios to conquer, and narrative threads to explore.”\\n\\n• Fire Emblem Fates Isn\\'t Afraid of Big, Bold, Choices [Killscreen] “You must decide whether to side with the people you just met who claim to be your real family (Birthright), the warmongering family who raised you as one of their own (Conquest), or strike out on your own (Revelation). In and of itself, this presents a radical alternative to the kind of end-game decision-making that you see in games like Mass Effect (2007) or Bastion (2011), where the player finally makes a choice with world historical consequences and is rewarded with one of a few end cutscenes depending on what they chose. The question Fire Emblem Fates asks is: What would happen if that choice were practically the first one you made? What if you could choose your family? Those divergent paths allow for you to get to know characters on both sides of the battlefield, making the morally uncomplicated instruction you’re often given to start battles—”rout the enemy”—much less of a given. Whether you see a certain character as friend or foe depends entirely on that choice you made, one that is irrevocable except by quite literally “playing out” the alternatives to it. Your family in Birthright becomes your sworn enemy in Conquest and something else altogether in Revelation. As motivations reveal themselves, sympathies shift. .”\\n\\n• Fire Emblem Awakening - Higher Ground [Polygon] “Awakening\\'s story focuses on a player-created Tactician character and Prince Chrom, heir to the throne. His country of Ylisse faces imminent invasion from a neighboring nation and an outbreak of attacking undead soldiers. As Prince Chrom\\'s new tactician, you lead his ragtag army of assorted job classes into battle against the warring nation. The plot of Awakening is linear, but there are enough extra missions and unpredictable plot twists to hold attention. Picking up optional fighters via sidequests adds narrative depth — especially when these characters have connections to others currently in your party. The relationships between characters develop and strengthen through cutscenes that are alternately humorous and heartfelt. As you eavesdrop on conversations in the barracks or take part in direct dialogue using the support feature, you\\'ll learn the backstory and personalities of individual characters. These relationships become the game\\'s main draw, adding a layer of humanity and warmth to a game of military tactics. The characters matter beyond the story as well. Each of the dozens of recruitable allies has a unique class or abilities that can completely reshape the battlefield. You never have to send the same team to battle twice, so missions never grow tedious.”\\n\\n• Fire Emblem Awakening - Games That I Like That I Become Obsessed With [Kotaku] “This is the core of the new Fire Emblem. It\\'s not squarely a war game. It\\'s a game about relationships. This was most unexpected. There have been Fire Emblem games on many Nintendo systems. We\\'ve gotten a bunch of them in America. The Sacred Stones was back on the Game Boy Advance. Shadow Dragon was on the DS. Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn on the Wii and GameCube. All are marvelous and rival the likes of X-Com, Final Fantasy Tactics and Advance Wars in the turn-based strategy genre. Fire Emblems stood out. They stood out for putting the genre in a dark fantasy sword-and-sorcery setting and for daring players to enjoy one of the great sadistic design choices in video games: permadeath. What the older Fire Emblems did for death, the new game does for relationships. What the older Fire Emblems did for death, the new game does for relationships. In some of the previous games in the series, characters could \"support\" each other. By standing next to each other in battle—based on where you placed them, of course—they\\'d gain an affinity for each other. They\\'d receive a stats boost and occasionally chitchat during or between missions. That once-obscure system is now one of Awakening\\'s most prominent features. Characters can pair up, occupying the same square and boosting each other\\'s stats.”',\n",

There’s also a bunch of other stuff in there about game scores and whether you need to complete games before reviewing them and so on, all of which is the exact same argument people have been having for, oh, about 25 years now.” [via: Rock Paper Shotgun]• Why Dunkey (and Many Others) Get It so Wrong About Game Review [Crave] “Dunkey’s misguided criticisms only stand to highlight the divide between the perception of how games media should operate, and the reality of how it needs to operate in order to meet readers’ expectations. Dunkey has become an increasingly prominent figure in online games criticism, with his videos veering from funny musings on the notoriously terrible MMO Roblox, through to insightful commentary on the likes of Hollow Knight and Yooka-Laylee. His channel has been gaining a lot of momentum in the past year or so, with his videos frequently being upvoted to the front page of Reddit and him standing out on YouTube amid a sea of Let’s Players and less accomplished comedy/gaming personalities. His latest video argues that outlets such as IGN should have a greater consistency with their reviews, and that the importance of “building an understanding between the critic and the viewer” is undermined when a site has multiple writers with different opinions, some of whom are “consistently wrong.” While Dunkey is just one lone (albeit popular) voice and his video would otherwise not be of that much importance, his opinions echo those of many readers, so I thought it was worth deconstructing his arguments and explaining why he’s completely wrong.”\\n\\n• Game Criticism Had Problems Long Before Dunkey Made a Video About It [Waypoint/Vice] “Otherwise, Dunkey\\'s video covers familiar but still unsettled ground, if you\\'ve been paying attention game criticism for the last decade. The searing text in a review doesn\\'t match the score, often falling between the 7-9 range; accepting advertisements from video game companies when you\\'re pretending to be impartial is, at best, a bad look; critics tend to latch onto familiar (and shared) language as an expressive crutch; coverage of new games tends to produce the most traffic, resulting in a rush to write articles without enough time to really understand the experience you\\'re talking about; the question of whether a reviewer needs to finish a game to have an opinion on it; how we determine the term \"fun\" in regards to quality. I\\'ve fallen victim to all of these. The video, whatever you think of the arguments, is scathing. Dunkey seemingly intended to provoke a reaction from the people he was criticizing, and based on the chatter I saw online, fallout that\\'s continued for days, he got exactly the reaction he was looking for: a defensive one. ”\\n\\n• I Don\\'t Follow Dunkey\\'s Contradictory Arguments About Video Game Critics [Forbes] “But IGN is serving a different, broader purpose than most YouTubers. IGN, as the largest video game site on the internet, is tasked with covering all the games they possibly can, from major to minor. It is simply impossible to do that without a veritable army of freelancers. IGN could not possibly keep up with its reviews with one or two people, and it’s impossible for YouTubers as well, which is why you simply don’t see any individual YouTubers cover as many games as a large site like IGN. But there is an audience for those who want timely coverage of every game on the market, so that’s why sites like IGN exist and have for years. There is also an audience for YouTubers picking their favorites to cover and doing so on their own time table, but one does not need to negate the other. Past this, though, I disagree with the notion that you can’t get to know the tastes and preferences of individual writers, freelancers or otherwise, like you can with YouTubers. If you just…find a reviewer you like and constantly follow their work, which in the age of social media is incredibly easy, you can attach yourself to different writers and learn just as much about them and their tastes as any YouTuber.”\\n\\n• The Unique Shame of the Video Game Critic [The Guardian] “Defending video games as a worthwhile subject during the medium’s emergent decades has been tough. The blockbusters are often flimsy carnivals of pyrotechnics studded with DOA dialogue. Perversely, they make great demands on the critic, who must frantically draw meaning and interest from what little is there. When an authentically interesting game comes along, the temptation for the honest critic is to overpraise and trip into advocacy of the medium (its own kind of well-meaning dishonesty). But no matter how scintillating the text, when the real world starts to tremble, when fascism begins to rise, when the bombs start to fall, when real lives and real rights are imperilled, the job of writing about virtual worlds is further undercut. Why waste our time focused on fictional quests when so much of the real world is in need of repair? Perhaps this guilt is not the provincial concern of the video game critic, but part of a broad historical tradition? Maybe, as the 4th-century BC writer sat down to fine-tune a skewering paragraph about one of Euripides’s productions (“the way the actor tucked his genitals behind his legs lacked conviction”), he was thus moved to hurl his writing reed in a moment of self-hating disgust. Who has time for this shit anyway, when the Spartans are coming?”\\n\\n• Philip Kollar, professional game reviewerbreaks down some of the points raised by Dunkey: @pkollar “ok at the risk of being yelled at by, uh, everyone, wanted to share some of my thoughts on @vgdunkey\\'s video on game critics”',\n",

The new character has been teased since before publisher Blizzard even released Overwatch, and now, players can finally try him out on Overwatch’s public test region. Doomfist [Developer Update] [Origin Story], whose real name is Akande Ogundimu, is a cybernetic offense character whose hand cannon gauntlet knocks opponents down. Blizzard writes, “In addition to dealing ranged damage with his Hand Cannon, Doomfist can slam the ground, knock enemies into the air and off balance, or charge into the fray with his Rocket Punch. When facing a tightly packed group, Doomfist leaps out of view, then crashes down to earth with a spectacular Meteor Strike.””• Some Early Thoughts On Overwatch\\'s Doomfist: Fun, Fresh, Flawed [Kotaku] “Doomfist is a melee fighter whose skillset leans more on well-timed punching combos than twitch reflexes. His primary fire is a hand cannon, a weak but easily-spammed bullet burst that comes right out of his knuckles. He’s also got a rocket punch, where he powers forward Superman-style, knocking back whomever his fist hits. His uppercut doubles as a high jump and, when he uses his Seismic Slam attack, he hops forward and smashes the ground, a little like Reinhardt’s ultimate ability. His ultimate ability is a devastating Meteor Strike (which he says out loud). He jumps up and slams his fist down, creating a crater that wrecks anybody within seven meters of him.”\\n\\n• Doomfist abilities list: here\\'s everything Overwatch\\'s new melee hero can do [PC Gamer] “\"Doomfist’s cybernetics make him a highly mobile, powerful frontline fighter.

What I mean is that I don’t feel like there are any heroes who are way too strong to the point of breaking balance. That doesn’t mean that I personally don’t think there are some problems with heroes. While I believe moving Roadhog away from a 1 shot combo was a necessary thing we had to do, I’m not entirely satisfied with where he’s at right now. I also think we need to do some brainstorming when it comes to Mercy’s resurrect, for example. The ability is extremely powerful in a very unfun way for both Mercy and everyone playing against that Mercy. But it’s not doomsday. These aren’t game breaking issues. They are better fixed slowly and carefully as the overall game is not ruined by them. I’m just using these as examples. But I think the game is balanced. Statistically, the things that are most unbalanced aren’t what you think they are. Symmetra and Torbjorn win rates are not balanced. They are too good. But this is why we don’t balance on statistics alone. I don’t sense a great community uproar over the fact that Torb and Symmetra are “overpowered” right now (at least, statistically). As I said last week, the perception of balance is more powerful than balance itself.”\\n\\n• Hero makes motion-sensing baguette controller for Overwatch’s Widowmaker [Polygon] “Using a breadboard and an actual loaf of French bread, game developer and Overwatch superfan Dylan Beck has created the ultimate weapon — an artisanally crafted, non-GMO, fully-leavened sniper rifle.

Via Kotaku, Anjali Bhimani–the voice of Symmetra in the game–posted a video online featuring the Overwatch performers showing off their “Happy Dance-iversary” moves. By far the funniest was Feodor Chin’s recreation of Zenyatta’s victory pose, which included the other actors holding Chin up in the air so he could do it without his feet touching the ground.

       "              '167837': 'The Alt-Right are complaining about Nazis being killed in video games [New Statesman] “The he use of minorities as stock villains is something that has plagued entertainment media for years. Now that political correctness has gone thankfully mad, it has become less acceptable to lean on generic brown terrorists, effeminate criminal masterminds or scheming mandarins when finding adversaries for an action hero to plow through. Video games may have lagged behind somewhat but many developers do at least make some effort to to avoid stereotyping. There is one notable exception, however. One beleaguered minority that seemingly has no voice in wider society. Nobody to stand up and say, \"Enough. Leave these poor people alone, you MONSTERS.\" I\\'m talking, of course, about Nazis.”• Watching internet Nazis get mad at Wolfenstein II is sadder than the game’s actual dystopia [The Verge] “The white nationalist alt-right is upset about Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus [Trailer] [YouTube], a game about fighting Nazis who control America in an alternate 1961. No one is surprised by this reaction, and coverage of it is one part schadenfreude, one part reminder that the new white supremacy hasn’t strayed far from its horrific roots. While these reminders are useful, the fact that Bethesda made racists mad is less interesting than watching the entire saga play out in the trailer’s YouTube comment section. Like many unmoderated comment sections, the Wolfenstein II trailer is the purest argument against the notion that a marketplace of ideas will improve the world. It’s a free-for-all between people who don’t know or care about each other, can’t figure out who’s serious, and are having their entire debate under a video about a man named “B.J. Blazkowicz” who’s been fighting cyborg Nazis since before many of them were born.”\\n\\n• I fought Nazis at Berkeley — and I can\\'t wait to punch them in \\'Wolfenstein II\\'[Mic] “I suppose the real craft of Wolfenstein II is that, in a game in which you can ride a fire-breathing cybernetic steed, the creative team has also managed to present Nazis in a way that simultaneously reflects the Nazi self-image and the lived experience of the barbarism they impose on others. The trailer likewise projects separate, grandiose narratives of horror and hope to the conflicting ideologies of the heroes and the villains. To the Nazi mind, the fear of fellow whites or Aryans applying their skills, knowledge and white privilege to aid the oppressed in annihilating them is paramount. But multi-class racial solidarity is the dream of the game. It’s my dream, too. I believe in fighting, to the death if needed, for the rights of immigrants, people of color, indigenous people, LGBT people and disabled people to live in our neighborhoods regardless of their documentation status or productivity under capitalism. I fight for human rights, because I’m human, bringing with me all the pain, contempt and anger that comes with that condition.”\\n\\n• The Surprising Importance of ‘Wolfenstein: The New Order’ [War is Boring] “Video games such as Wolfenstein are important because we’ve begun to lose ideological arguments with the current crop of extremist assholes. Racism, genocide and all the other bits of awful that make up Nazi ideology are bad, but we’ve long taken that for granted. Part of the reason the alt-right and the new white nationalists are resurgent is because we’ve forgotten how to win arguments against them. For decades, most people understood that Nazi ideology was bad. We were close enough to the history that we didn’t need to have anyone explain it to us. Too often, when we engage in arguments with extremists who talk of racial purity, we falter to explain our side. Instead, we punch them and tell them “because.” To be clear, sometimes the only way to win against a Nazi is to punch them. But we also need to understand and be ready to explain the reasons why racism, genocide and white nationalism are bad. This may seem simplistic and rudimentary, it may even make you angry, but we must be ready to explain to young people why these ideas are so poisonous. It is no longer enough to just point at the history and say “because.””\\n\\n• Wolfenstein: New Order and Nazis in videogames [Den of Geek] “But what if someone created a game about a young Nazi recruit drafted into the Warsaw Ghetto, where the atrocities happening around your character leads him to question the Nazi cause and help with an alt-history version of the Warsaw Rising? Maybe that would also be too raw a topic for Germany to tackle at this point, but it would certainly challenge the gaming norm, and convey the message that videogames are capable of being ‘art’ as well as big kids’ toys. Just as there will always be room for Inglorious Basterds in cinema, there will always be room for carefree Nazicide in videogames. However, cinema has its Schindler’s List, The Pianist, Stalingrad (1993), and countless other films that show some humanity amid the atrocities of World War II. The fascinating, harrowing topic of Nazism is just one of many that videogames need to tackle in a thoughtful way if they’re to mature. The problem, as New Order shows, is that there is no more satisfying videogame enemy to kill than a Nazi.”\\n\\n• Who\\'s Afraid of the Swastika? Nazi Symbols in Video Games [Game Pressure] “Treating games as “second class citizens” has serious implications for developers, putting them against a tough choice: whether to leave Nazi symbols in the game and create a separate edition specially for German players, lose potential customers in this 80 million people country, or spare themselves extra work at the cost of realism. This is not a new problem – as early as in 1989 the creators of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (a game based on the film mentioned in the previous paragraph) had to cover all swastikas in order to prevent the game from being banned in Germany. The result? Red flags with white circle and an awkward black square in the middle. In turn, Call of Duty series replaced Nazi emblems with the Iron Cross, a symbol used back in the times of Prussia. Even in the last year section 86a caused problems for game developers in at least two cases. Ubisoft had to delay the release date of South Park: The Stick of Truth in Germany, after a sole swastika was found in the game after it was cleared off Nazi emblems. However, that was nothing compared to Wolfenstein: The New Order, whose distributor, Bethesda Softworks company, had to create a separate version of the official website for Germany (only the international version contained playable Wolfenstein 3D, which was full of forbidden symbols) and replace every single emblem unwanted in Germany with a made up symbol – which was quite troublesome, as the game was set in the universe crawling with the Nazis.”\\n\\n• We shall fight them on the Xbox: a short history of Nazi-shooting video games [The Guardian] “This summer will deliver the first second-world-war blockbuster in many years in Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk. Nazis, in the form of exaggerated caricatures, zombie monsters, or historical figures ripe for assassination, are in vogue again. They offer us uncomplicated, centrally organised bad guys, a simplistic antidote to today’s dispersed, incognito pariahs. The Nazi invasion will surely soon spread from Hollywood into video games. Sniper Elite 4, a British-made game released last month, in which you play as an agent of the US Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner of the CIA) fighting fascists in 1943 Italy, leads the charge. Time slows to a crawl when you fire a shot from your sniper rifle. The camera tracks the bullet as it spins through air, then cloth, then flesh and bone. It’s grimly pornographic, at once satisfying and icky. Perhaps we will never tire of this black-and-white conflict, on to which we can project our fears and anger, and feel the self-satisfaction of knowing that we were on the winning side.”\\n\\n• 20 Years of Killin\\' Nazis: A Retrospective [IGN] “Wolfenstein 3D didn\\'t just kickstart a genre. It started a sub-genre while it was at it: WWII shooters. Many developers have since turned their attention to the Second World War era, and why not? It was the largest and most devastating conflict in human history. Unfortunately, so many developers did so that World War II shooters became cliche, stigmatised by vocal detractors as ubiquitous and unoriginal. Today, however, as our increasingly homogenised shooters refuse to budge from their bleeding-edge contemporary (or near-future) backdrops perhaps a return to 1939-1945 could be a surprisingly fresh approach? ”',\n",

Former governor Bobby Jindal positioned himself for a presidential run by slashing taxes and cutting spending, pinning his fiscal policy on the hopes that oil revenues from the Gulf of Mexico would continue to grow.  Those revenues have failed to materialize, leaving the state with a deficit.  Since higher education funding is one of the largest components of the state’s discretionary spending, it was one of the hardest areas hit.  Louisiana has made deeper cuts to education than any other state, and colleges in Louisiana are receiving 55% less state funding than they did before the recession.  The state now finds itself with a gap of $850 million for this year, and more than $2 billion next year.  The result has been steeply rising tuition and decreased enrollment.  It’s about to get much, much worse.Last night, in an address to the state, Governor John Bel Edwards warned that the state’s flagship university, LSU, will be unable to pay bills past April 30th, and that the university would shut down unless an emergency session of the legislature approves additional spending.  Classes would be cancelled, students would receive grades of “incomplete” for spring semester classes, campus construction projects would stop, and the university might lose its accreditation.\\n\\nIf that’s not enough, Edwards played his ace:  the shutdown would render LSU’s student-athletes academically ineligible for fall competition.

While the Supreme Court decisions eliminating life without parole for juveniles have been hailed as victories of criminal-justice reform, some states are dragging their heels when it comes to giving juvenile lifers their day in court.Miller v. Alabama (2012) established that indiscriminately sentencing people under 18 to die in prison is unconstitutional. Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016) requires the Miller decision to be applied retroactively. These decisions establish that resentencing must take into account the fact that juveniles are inherently less culpable than adults due to brain-development patterns and their potential to be rehabilitated. In these cases, advocates successfully proved that teenagers sentenced to life in prison weren’t the irredeemable “superpredators” that they were made out to be in the 1980s and ’90s, when most of these individuals were sentenced—and that they didn’t deserve to die in prison.',\n",

This pronoun choice has two effects. Firstly, it successfully erases grammatical difference in the novel and makes moot the question of the characters’ genders. But secondly, it exists in a context of continuing discussions around the gendering of science fiction, the place of men and women and people of other genders within the genre, as characters in fiction and as professional/fans, and beyond the pages of the book it is profoundly political.

Picasso did not paint the world as he saw it. He painted it as he processed it in the same way that vidders do. Vidding is a lie that makes people see the truth. When working through a lyrical interpretation of a vidsong, aim to make choices that strengthens that truth you are trying to vid and let that drive the lyrical interpretations.\\nA History of Vidding: Kandy Fong, a Star Trek fan based in Phoenix, Arizona watched “Strawberry Fields Forever” and realized she could do something similar for her favorite TV show. Her soon-to-be husband had access to film clips from Star Trek TV episodes. These were actual clips of 35mm film that had been left on the Desilu Studios editing room floor during production of the series in the 1960s. These film clips were then mounted into slides and sold to collectors. In addition, Kandy had a slide projector carousel and a cassette tape player. She now had music, video, and source, the three main ingredients to making a fanvid.\\n\\nSound and Story, an essay about soundwork in vidding and in the popular Marvel fanvid 'Glitter and Gold':It’s the soundwork that emphasizes their physicality of the characters, reminding us of the opening lyric of flesh and bone; we are cued not to think of these superheroes as 2-D comic book cutouts but as real three-dimensional bodies. The sounds of human effort are layered into the music with perfect synchronicity, so that we hear grunting, the crunch of bone, the crack of gunshots – things that mark the collision of people and things in a way that makes the fighting feel real; we can feel it in our teeth.\\nHow to Leave This Show, about a fanvid which combines clips from the Golden Age of Hollywood with Glee's Kurt Hummel:Lola’s song choice is “Sort Of” by Ingrid Michaelson. It’s about a couple in an unequal relationship. The singer is too intense and too invested in a lover who doesn’t reciprocate her feelings. The lyrics, read as a single, coherent arc, are not a perfect, literal match for the vid’s thesis, but rather shift in implication from clip to clip, verse to verse. And though Kurt’s boyfriend has an important role to play, Lola’s primary interest isn’t shipping. Michaelson’s refrain goes, “My love’s too big for you, my love.” Lola’s “you” isn’t Blaine, though, but—well. Kurt is a gay boy in a small town. It doesn’t matter who or what is the object; Kurt loves many things. His love is always already too frightening and too big.\\n\\n\\nStill have time on your hands?

Digital technology empowers us as never before, yet it has unforeseen consequences as well. Potentially humiliating content on Facebook is enshrined in cyberspace for future employers to see. Google remembers everything we've searched for and when. The digital realm remembers what is sometimes better forgotten, and this has profound implications for us all.\\n\\nIn Delete, Viktor Mayer-Schönberger traces the important role that forgetting has played throughout human history, from the ability to make sound decisions unencumbered by the past to the possibility of second chances. The written word made it possible for humans to remember across generations and time, yet now digital technology and global networks are overriding our natural ability to forget--the past is ever present, ready to be called up at the click of a mouse. Mayer-Schönberger examines the technology that's facilitating the end of forgetting--digitization, cheap storage and easy retrieval, global access, and increasingly powerful software--and describes the dangers of everlasting digital memory, whether it's outdated information taken out of context or compromising photos the Web won't let us forget. He explains why information privacy rights and other fixes can't help us, and proposes an ingeniously simple solution--expiration dates on information--that may.\\n\\nDelete is an eye-opening book that will help us remember how to forget in the digital age.\\n\",\n",

Since the early '90s it has got much less dangerous. \\n\\nSo you could argue that parents are adjusting to the crime rate with a lag.

They walk in groups to school in the morning, but walk on their own home. It helps that the school is just a few blocks from our house.\\n\\nAfter school all the neighbourhood kids gather at our house because we\\'re located next to an old-timey candy store.

I have no idea where they go.\\n\\nThis will change in the second half of the first year of middle school, when students must join club activities. Club activities continue after school until 6pm, when the students go home. Many students will then go to cram school after dinner a couple of nights a week (I used to run a cram school; it was fun), and this will continue until the end of high school and the end of childhood.\\n\\nObjectively speaking, Japan is safer than the United States, and I would say it\\'s safer than Canada.

I write this on the cusp on going home for a while, and much has been on my mind.\\n\\nGabriel Garcia Marquez once confessed to having patricidal feelings about Faulkner. The literature of much of Latin America has much in common with the literature of the South for good historical reasons--both emerged from a stewpot of failed pseudo-feudalism based around the production of raw goods by slaves whose labors and efforts produced enormous wealth for the land-owning gentry, gentry who later lost most of their wealth and inherent social station in subsequent civil war (or in the case of Latin America, war(s)). \\n\\nIn Democracy in America, Alexis De Tocqueville made some curious observations of the South in America as he encountered it in the early 1800s, (and I will have to generalize here, but I recommend reading that whole book at least once in your life): that the Southern aristocracy was made lazy by their leisure, but more obsessed with high minded thoughts of Roman and Greek philosophy than their industrial counterparts to the North; that the South was in a strange position as regards what he believed to be the eventual collapse of the plantation system, as the slave system was race based and not just class based, and so the freeing of the slaves would not result in generational absorption into the wider strata of society because prejudice against race would continue regardless of freedom; that the North, when abolishing slavery, allowed slave owners to sell their slaves South in order to recoup the expenses of their \"property\", whereas he suspected that in the South, there would be no such way to move-by-sale the slave population or recoup the investment expense (and as horrifying as it is to speak of slavery in these terms, the horror of the economics of slavery must be looked at full and honestly), and so, he imagined, the South would have to, at some point in its history, reckon with the task of integrating two populations of people--one enslaved, and one the enslavers--the latter of whom did not want to be reconciled. \\n\\nAdd to this that the South is deeply religious--and not of the Puritanical variety of faith, or the institutionally strong Lutheran and Presbyterian traditions of the Midwest--but of the Baptist and Methodist strains, a dash of Catholicism (or mostly Catholic, in the case of Latin America), of faiths that emerged from revivals and circuit riding preachers, of the evangelicalism that emerges when American ideals of independence and self-determination get turned towards the good book, such that people in their homes are reading the Bible and taking it upon themselves to interpret its contents without knowledge of how it came to be. \\n\\nTake all of these and mix them together with war, with an independently armed populace, with poverty, with a working-class white population who has never known anything but crumbs from the white upper class and fighting against their black and now Mexican immigrant peers for labor. Take all of this and mix together with corruption, with the once-landed-gentry trying with all their might to rebuild some kind of power--\\n\\nAnd you will get what you have in the South today. \\n\\nThe error that outsiders always make about the South is that they don\\'t understand Southerners are outwardly meanest to family and nicest to strangers, because nicety is a way to keep people out of your business while still getting what you need from them. What outsiders don\\'t understand is that God, and Jesus, and the Devil are real--that the South operates with a cosmology that has a heaven and a hell and a living God who interferes with daily life and subjects all of us to the unknown whims and motivations of divinity--and because these entities are dueling around and between us, the temporary alliances and betrayals between humans, the unfair caste system in which people are a part, are dealt with in terms of blessings and curses instead of policy and government. What outsiders don\\'t understand is that a person\\'s behavior isn\\'t about what is right and wrong, but what is known by your peers, and what you can get away with when it is just you and God--a God who, by the way, will forgive your believed-in brokenness in all its forms. And what outsiders don\\'t understand is that the word Southerner does not mean white redneck, although there are plenty of those to be found. The black citizens of the South are Southern too, and in many ways more so, as it is their food and music and culture and language that has had the largest influence on what can be called Southern and what attributes are claimed as Southern by the white citizens among them. \\n\\nWhat outsiders don\\'t understand is that Southerners have been talking about race forever, while much of the rest of the country is just joining the conversation, and that the South knows that it has failed repeatedly to find an answer to institutional and personal racism, and so the white people who care about racism try to amend this failure in their daily life and interactions (and increasingly in government, thank goodness), and those that don\\'t care move on with their niceties while throwing their hands up and saying that\\'s just how the Lord made things to be. Meanwhile those that are actively invested in keeping the races separate become race terrorists, using symbols and violence and death and incarceration to maim and kill and destroy the lives of the South\\'s black citizens while much of the rest of its residents look away. And what outsiders don\\'t understand is that the white South hates being reminded of this apathy and impotence in the face of the terror wrought by its own, because truth be told, the rest of country is looking away from the violence of their own systems as well, all while pointing at the South as though it is the only region with a race problem. \\n\\nSo when people come down, move in, talk about how nice everyone is, and live with their secular humanist worldview all while saying how good the food is, they are really just tourists enjoying the outward fruits of an insular culture so deeply knotted in its tragedies and failures and limping survival that it is inscrutable and confusing to those not born in the tangle. But there is a sense to it--and by sense, I mean reason and not excuse--if you have an ear for myth or can put aside your need for logic to resolve, because in the South the answer is often A and Not A, the answer is a paradox, and that\\'s just the way it is.',\n",

It\\'s worth familiarizing yourself with them if you want to understand some of the more persistent tropes that weave their way through the stories people tell about racial relations in the south. \\n\\nIf you want a more specific reference, you might look at page 47 of Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre. There, you will find a characteristic example of the rhetoric I am discussing: Charles Manigault writes in his memoirs that his family and his slaves lived close together, so much so that their children played together, and that this resulted in \"mutual family interests, and kind personal feelings.\" This is a common form of slavery apologia: the assertion that physical closeness and economic dependence (which is framed as mutual instead of exploitative) leads to familial feelings and to the contentment and benefit of all parties involved. \\n\\nYou might be willing to take Mr. Manigault\\'s word for it and imagine that he was a particularly benign slave owner. However, it is worth noting that 90% of the slaves born on his plantation died before they reached 15 years of age, a fate against which  Mr. Manigault\\'s alleged \"kind personal feelings\" gave no protection. \\n\\n[(Let me digress to say that certainly a 90% childhood death rate is substantially worse than the current infant mortality rate in Mississippi, but the current infant and maternal morality rates in Mississippi are still abysmally bad, and twice as bad for black women and infants as for whites (this racial pattern exists throughout the US).]\\n\\nAnyway, when people start talking about what racial relations are like in the south and referencing the close physical proximity of black servants and the friendly relations between the races (as though the friendliness is one thing and verbalized racism is somehow completely separable from it), it reminds me of this particular strain of rhetoric. That and the lyrical romanticism about the complexity of racial relationships in the south--it is simply very stylistically reminiscent of a certain strain of white post-Civil War memoir which you might want to become acquainted with if you are interested in this topic.',\n",

An inquiry that has judgmental overtones.\\nOral Complaint. An oral challenge to the presence and/or appropriateness of the material in question.\\nWritten Complaint. A formal, written complaint filed with the institution (library, school, etc.), challenging the presence and/or appropriateness of specific material.\\nPublic Attack. A publicly disseminated statement challenging the value of the material, presented to the media and/or others outside the institutional organization in order to gain public support for further action.\\nCensorship. A change in the access status of material, based on the content of the work and made by a governing authority or its representatives. Such changes include exclusion, restriction, removal, or age/grade level changes.\\n\\nFor more information and resources on challenges to library materials, please see challenge support, essential preparation, and reporting a challenge.\\n\\nThe Top Ten Most Frequently Challenged books list is compiled with expert analysis by the Office for Intellectual Freedom staff. “Challenges” are documented requests to remove materials from schools or libraries.  Removal would restrict access to this information by other library users. This list is not scientifically compiled.  Rather, it is a snapshot of the reports we receive every day. In some cases we get numerous details about the challenger, the nature of the complaint, the backstory, and the current status of the book.  And in some cases we get very little. Sometimes we receive information during the challenge event, sometimes many years later. These factors affect the total number of challenged books for any given year and how we inform the public.\\n\\nOur goal is not to focus on the numbers, but to educate the community that censorship is still a very serious problem. Even with all of our efforts to follow up and provide support, surveys indicate that up to 85% of book challenges receive no media attention and remain unreported. ',\n",

No censor thinks that banning a work will erase it from the population's memory, except maybe in Myanmar or North Korea. Even then, I'm not so sure. \\n\\nThe intent is to create a philosophical walled garden as a statement. It creates an asymmetrical situation where those within the garden get special, constricted views that reinforce existing modes of reasoning and experience. With little indication that the garden exists beyond some fuzzy notion of right and correct and healthy. \\n\\nBanning a book from a school or a public library has the effect and intent of restricting those for whom it is not too late to keep in the garden.

They may be unaware of the walled garden they are in. You can't miss anything you didn't know was there. \\n\\nSo, reporting on banned books is important because it puts red circles around holes to show everyone, equally, what parts are missing. \\n\\nI'll finish with an appeal to those who would argue the false argument of false dichotomy. It is a truism that all cultures censor. We don't allow certain things and we always have. \\n\\nPointing out the holes is also something that angers many so called moderates who would normally be unsupportive of classic censorship. Banning a book is one thing, but silencing or ignoring material that points out problems with, for example, globalism or environmental degradation is often a way of not letting all of us see the holes that exist in out own comfortable manner of living.\\n\\nSo, there's censorship, there's censorship, and there's censorship. \\n\\nWhen considering these, it maybe more helpful to consider who is harmed most by making a thing into a hole.\",\n",

I laughed and I was like, \"I own that book, I read that book to my toddlers, it\\'s hilarious and it\\'s won a bunch of awards.\" Although TO BE FAIR it does have poems about boy parts and girl parts, and one called \"Consider the Anus.\" (\"The anus is the exit / for the waste your body makes, / a thankless job / (but someone has to do it). / Your anus is reliable / and rarely makes mistakes. / It loves its job / (though most of us poo-poo it).\") In the end they moved the book out of the kindergarten classroom it was in, and in to the school library poetry section, so kids would have to actively seek it out instead of running across it.\\n\\nThe other was Iggy\\'s House by Judy Blume, which the parent complained was \"supporting racism\" to which I responded, \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" It\\'s a famous 1970 novel about the end of redlining and the integration of formerly all-white suburbs and how the black and white children, who become friends, fight the racism of their older neighbors and confront their old-fashioned beliefs. (It was not part of the curriculum, but a book her high-achieving daughter chose from the school library for extended reading after her teacher recommended Judy Blume as an author she would enjoy.)

Sure, you and I can scoff at the ignoramus who wants \"Huck Finn\" pulled from the American Lit curriculum, but the point here is really to say to a 14-year-old, \"Someone wants to remove this book from the curriculum because of the n-word, what do you think?\" and hear the 14-year-old weigh the use of the word in context and whether the book\\'s helpful or harmful to her and her classmates. The only way you get adults who can make nuanced value judgments about why even though the n-word is bad it might be important to read a novel with the n-word in it is by helping kids start thinking through and making those arguments themselves, and having them articulate why understanding the historical context of the novel, and the word itself, is really important for understanding American history and literature.',\n",

The book was older - maybe mid 70\\'s? - so it was also kind of dusty and not very attractive looking to today\\'s kids.\\n\\nThis happened about 5 years ago in a small, rural library.  We didn\\'t have a wide selection of \"Religions of the World\" books for children.

       "              '6225874': 'In my author debut group, there were about 30 YA authors all being published for the first time in 2009. Two of us were officially challenged. It wasn\\'t just one random malcontent complaining about their books. There was national news coverage of a protracted controversy, during which both authors got streams of support, but also streams of hate mail and threats. They were publicly called pedophiles and pornographers. \\n\\nTheir books were not targeted because they were on required reading lists. In one case, the book was challenged simply for existing in the high school library. (As of this writing, five years later, that book is technically in the high school library, but students have to have permission to check it out-- along with one of Kurt Vonnegut\\'s books, which was challenged at the same time.) The librarian who responded to the challenge was subsequently forced to resign her position at the school.\\n\\nIn the other case, I believe the book was on a suggested summer reading list. It wasn\\'t required, it was just a list of newer YA books that teens could find at the local library. The challenge ensued and while these books stayed in the library, without special permission required to read them, the school district opted to get rid of the suggested reading list entirely. \\n\\nThose are the official challenges. 2 out of 30, not so bad. But at least 17 of us have been (variously) disinvited from school or library (that is, we were invited until the invite was suddenly rescinded at the objection of a parent,)  our books been removed from panels at conferences after initial invitation, we\\'ve had teachers request school visits, but specifically request that specific book content would be forbidden to discuss, and had book fairs either a) specifically request altering our text to include or or b) specifically decline our books due to content.\\n\\nAll of this happens, on top of librarians telling us-- privately-- that they championed our books for their collections, but the selectors decided they weren\\'t worth the risk. When books are challenged, teachers and librarians literally put their jobs on the line to defend those books. I certainly can\\'t blame someone for deciding that their livelihood is more important to them than my novel on their shelves.\\n\\nChallenged books and books that are challengeable continues to be a major free speech issue. Just because it may seem quaint to some, this continues to be a real issue, especially in smaller communities. I know a librarian who had to figure out a way to sneak queer books for teens onto the shelves. The library administration didn\\'t object to queer fiction per se, but they worried it would \"become an issue\" with their readers. The librarian eventually started putting together \"Award Winning\" end caps. And it just so happened that she chose all Lambda Literary and YALSA Stonewall Award Winners.\\n\\nPublishers take into account whether they think a book is worth the possible legal ramifications of its text. The two authors that I discussed above? Their publishers spent an extraordinary amount of money fighting the challenge. Most publishers do put forth that effort once it happens. But they certainly consider on their profit and loss sheet at acquisitions whether they think a particular book would be worthy of it, if it happened. A lot of times, the answer is no.\\n\\nThere are books that are never allowed to exist because they might be challenged. With distressing regularity, the voices that get lost as those that most need amplification. Fiction by authors of color, urban fiction, queer fiction, female-focused fiction-- and as we\\'re seeing with the challenge on The Strange Second Life of Henrietta Lacks, it\\'s also an attack on factual, scientific non-fiction. I\\'m horrified at the thought of an acquisition team deciding it\\'s not worth it to publish books about evolution, vaccines, the origin of the universe, women\\'s health, the Tuskegee experiments, and on and on.\\n\\nThis is why Banned Books Week is important. This entire system is made out of people. Authors get scared, librarians get scared, publishers get scared-- it reminds us of why we fight-- it reminds me that for every crackpot who gave me a hard time about the gay kid in my book in 2009, that I\\'ve met two queer kids who took hope and strength from it. \\n\\nAnd it reminds everyone else that there is a fight, that it\\'s a worthy battle, and it\\'s one that is constantly waged. Without everyone else, without the parents who do want their kids to read about Henrietta Lacks, and the communities that step up to say it\\'s unacceptable to let one person decide what the whole city reads, without the readers who just want that book to be there when they need it or when someone else does-- without those people, then our voices disappear. \\n\\nThat\\'s why we still have Banned Books week.

In other words, it spins in the same direction it always has, just upside down, so that looking at it from other planets makes the spin seem backward. Scientists have argued that the sun\\'s gravitational pull on the planet\\'s very dense atmosphere could have caused strong atmospheric tides. Such tides, combined with friction between Venus\\'s mantle and core, could have caused the flip in the first place.\\n\\nNow Alexandre Correira and Jacques Laskar suggest that Venus may not have flipped at all. They propose instead that its rotation slowed to a standstill and then reversed direction. ...\\n\\nThat from a SciAm  article in 2001 -- but one of the leading contemporary theories among many has resurrected the \"unholy smack\" and pushed it back a few billion years, apparently: Venus may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun\\'s gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.[92][93] The 584-day average interval between successive close approaches to Earth is almost exactly equal to 5 Venusian solar days,[94] but the hypothesis of a spin–orbit resonance with Earth has been discounted.[95]\\n\\nVenus has no natural satellites.[96] It has several co-orbital asteroids: the quasi-satellite 2002 VE68[97][98] and two other temporary co-orbitals, 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE133.[99] In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported a moon orbiting Venus, which was named Neith and numerous sightings were reported over the following 200 years, but most were determined to be stars in the vicinity. Alex Alemi\\'s and David Stevenson\\'s 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the California Institute of Technology shows Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago.[100] About 10 million years later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet\\'s spin direction and caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus.[101] If later impacts created moons, these were removed in the same way.[emphasis added] An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.[96]\\n\\nI was startled to learn that, based on the sixteen year sample window \"between the Magellan spacecraft and Venus Express visits\", Venus\\' rotation is slowing down 6.5 minutes per Venusian sidereal day (116.75 Earth days).

While there are organisms which have evolved to be extremely frugal with phosphorus or sulfur, but every single biological molecule in animals is H based.  Fats are mostly CH, carbohydrates are a mix of CHO, amino acids are NHCOS, DNA is PCHON.  Water is H20, alcohols are CHO.  Note every single one of these has hydrogen, and except for water they all have carbon.  If you know of any organisms which are H-free, I would like to hear about it.  There is a huge amount of biochemistry which is all based on H atoms moving around and their large scale interactions.\\n\\nOK - we're really carbon based rather than H based and not having a magnetic field (or a very small one ) means that there are more charged particles from the sun that get through which cause mutations - which is solved by going underground or in caves.\\n\\nThe big problem is that all the light weight molecules in your atmosphere (like H2) will get peeled off by the solar winds eventually.  H20 will cycle through being H2 and O2, and over a very long time the H2 will all fly off into space.  This is why Venus has an atmosphere composed of relatively heavy molecules which the solar wind could not scrape off.  If you try terraforming you are committed to getting more H2 (likely as water) in the long term, since Venus will not maintain a steady state level of hydrogen (granted, the dissipation may take millennia).  \\n\\nThe risk from charged particles if you are actually in the atmosphere is pretty low, since all those high molecular weight particles will block solar radiation and charged particles.\",\n",
